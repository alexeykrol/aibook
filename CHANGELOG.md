## ⚙️ Methodology Section

### Added

#### **Book Development Methodology**
Detailed explanation of the unique approach to creating this book:

**Tools Used:**
- **GitHub**: Version control, team collaboration, main branch protection
- **VS Code**: Text editor for collaborative writing
- **Claude Code (Codex MAX)**: AI agent as super-assistant

**Division of Roles:**

**👤 Author's Role:**
- Writes ALL text (AI does NOT write or edit artistic/authorial texts)
- Makes all creative decisions
- Maintains artistic vision

**🤖 AI's Role (80% of responsible writer's work):**
- Analysis and structuring (plot lines, intersections, mentions)
- Fact-checking (historical facts, dates, events)
- Research (information, quotes, references)
- Logical control (finding plot holes and contradictions)
- Lore management (maintaining context, characters, events database)
- Character development (analyzing motivations, arcs, connections)
- Assembly and organization (project structure, scenes, chapters)

**Results:**
- 50x speed increase for research and analytical work
- Frees author for creative work
- Particularly effective for:
  - Fact-heavy genres (historical works, biographies)
  - Complex plot structures (series, franchises)
  - Multiple intersecting storylines (screenplays, action)
