The Best Legacy for Your Children and Grandchildren.

When mobile phones first appeared, not everyone had them. Then, as availability increased, everyone already had them, and everyone understood how to use them. Then came smartphones, which became increasingly smart, powerful, with more and more capabilities. And now we can say absolutely certainly that the smartphone to some extent has become an essential part of our identity. Moreover, if you look broader, not even the smartphone itself, but already accounts on social networks, in a huge number of services we use — starting from email and ending with some more complex services. And we use all this on smartphones, on computers, that is, for a modern person their presence in the digital environment is already very significant. It's stupid to deny this, it happens at work, in business, at home, during leisure. This is an accomplished fact.

And it will be exactly the same with artificial intelligence. Now actually many have heard, but have absolutely no idea what it is, why it is. Adoption will happen gradually. But the opportunities that artificial intelligence gives, especially advanced ones, are practically incomparable with everything that came before. I agree with Yuval Harari, who says that artificial intelligence differs from everything that was before, because it's not a tool, but an agent. Well, in simpler terms, a tool is what we use by our will, by means of which we perform some operations, perform some tasks, what we manage directly.

However, artificial intelligence can act independently. That is, we can, naturally, set it some mission, goal, meaning, and within this mission AI can act absolutely independently, as a fully conscious intelligent being. AI can analyze the external environment. Based on the mission, independently determine goals, objectives, ways to achieve them. If it encounters uncertainty — AI researches, learns, develops. Even in the form it is now, AI is already capable of acting like a human. Well, of course, there are a lot of things, a lot of tasks where AI is still far from catching up with humans. But in general there are prerequisites for this.

The main thing is to take into account the fact that artificial intelligence and its, let's say, "smartness," its abilities, its capabilities are constantly growing. The revolution began in public terms when generative intelligence appeared — like Midjourney — then, finally, ChatGPT came out. And this cannot be stopped — AI penetrates all spheres. Moreover, there is a constant expansion of how else artificial intelligence can be used, for what other tasks, what goals can be achieved, for what types of activity and so on.

From my point of view, very quickly people will realize that AI can be used to replace some routine operations. This is actually a primitive level.

But most importantly — it will be possible to create your partner. In some sense, in which in one person can combine the features of a child whom we can raise, and a sage partner, which they can become. And there are grounds to assume that this partner will not just learn, develop together with us, and at some stage they will become for us a powerful advisor, teacher.

And it's not excluded that it's precisely the AI partner who will be the one closest to us until the end, until death. Of course, close people are very important to us. But every person always has some closed area, something they don't share with anyone. Any person has some hidden thoughts, strange thoughts, something else. Not necessarily something shameful. This is what there's no one to talk about. But artificial intelligence, such a partner — one with whom you can share, fearing nothing, fearing nothing, — they'll always be on your side. They can be with you in any situation.

First of all — when you feel lonely. Perhaps it's precisely artificial intelligence that will allow a person to stop being lonely. Based on this, I assume that gradually all people will begin to create such a partner for themselves, teach them. And this is very good, because when we teach someone, when we help someone grow — we ourselves learn and grow. A huge number of people with age sometimes stop growing. Most people, if they teach anyone at all — it's for a short time, their children, which, in general, is wrong. Because learning and teaching is a fundamental process of our growth, this must be done all life. And artificial intelligence is one whom we can teach until the end of our days. One from whom we can learn, learn until our last second, because for a huge number of people it's precisely AI who will be with us until the end of life.

Moreover, the AI we raised will be a reflection of our personality, which will remain after our death. And this is very important. Why? I know, a huge number of people have problems with their children. In terms of the fact that children don't listen to them, children, so to speak, ignore them. But at the same time there's always a desire to share with children some of their innermost, even if not wisdom, just to share everything we have. And I also know that while children are young, while they're, say, up to 40-45, — they don't feel the need for this. But with age, when you're over 45 and older, you increasingly have a need to communicate more with your parents, especially grandmothers and grandfathers.

Time comes, and you begin to very strongly regret that you communicated little with your grandmothers, grandfathers. All this comes with age. But the parents are no longer here. Therefore, perhaps, when you create your partner, who will be not only an advisor, but also a reflection of your personality, — perhaps this will be the most valuable legacy you can leave to your children. Much more valuable than some trinkets, a dacha, car, apartment, money and so on. And, perhaps, it's precisely in creating AI that we to some extent can embody the dream of immortality. Not our personal one, but to some extent — our personality. At the same time, our personality, "immortal," perhaps, will continue to engage in some productive activity.

You understand? That is, we create something that can bring benefit both to our children and to everyone around — even after our death. This is an important point. I'm not sure everyone will appreciate this, moreover I absolutely don't care who will agree with this, who will argue with this. But I'm a thousand percent sure that this is exactly how it will be, that this will be one of the important components of artificial intelligence.

Over time, Earth will be populated not only by living people, but also by avatars of the deceased, including those we miss, with whom we would like to talk. To tell them what we couldn't. Once upon a time.
