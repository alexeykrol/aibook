**There used to be chatbots. Now something new.**

1. There used to be chatbots — this is a rather primitive technology where you set up a bot for simple user reactions, but of course, there's no real "bot." You write the responses yourself, create dialogue trees, load documents in response to predetermined responses. You've all seen this in various companies' support systems. In 5% of appeals, the bot solves your problem, but in 95% of cases, you need to communicate with a person via chat or phone.

2. Over the past year, people have cranked out Assistants. What are they? It's an ordinary AI chat, under the hood of which is the same chatGPT (in 90% of cases), i.e., it seems to you that you're communicating with some unique AI, but that's not the case. How do clever programmers do this?

3. They take a free ChatUI framework (can be downloaded anywhere), connect it with chatGPT. Can be direct, can be through some Zapier. 99% of services are made this way, you just pay money not to OpenAI but to an intermediary, moreover, with a markup of 1000%. But essentially, it's the same chatGPT (or similar chat), i.e., this is not an AI agent that we discussed in one of the previous posts. All AI bots in Telegram are made the same way. A money pipeline.

4. There are also services that promise you can CREATE your UNIQUE assistant. Same eggs, side view, you're still communicating with THE SAME chatGPT, it's just that your prompt doesn't go alone, but each time a "personality description" is added to it — like — "You're a beautiful girl, answering me in cute-cute style." This is a scam for the ignorant. All sorts of sultry AI girls, and others.

4. Finally, there are assistant builders that allow you to add your documents, materials, and you CAN CREATE YOUR DIGITAL unique avatar, which will be based on your data, and they, of course, will be safe. And again, here standard Open AI (or someone from them) capabilities are exploited, but there's one addition that I'll write about below. And again, this is NOT YET an AI agent. Why?

**What's the difference between a real AI agent and an AI assistant?**

5. An assistant is just chatGPT, i.e., a one-time action, you need to constantly communicate with it or through API, but then it doesn't remember anything — smart but dumb.

An agent is capable of performing chains of many actions, maintaining flow, making decisions, analyzing, clarifying, interacting with other Agents and people, i.e., essentially creating an entire org. structure of AI agents and working 100% autonomously under conditions of uncertainty, receiving unstructured data.

That is, an Assistant cannot REPLACE a marketer or accountant, for example, but can only HELP them with performing certain tasks.

6. But an Agent can 100% replace an entire marketing department or a huge accounting department, when instead of a friendly female collective of 50 people, 2 people remain — the chief accountant who thoroughly understands the subject and a developer (not a programmer) of the AI agent, the one who can build the workflow (process) of the entire department, connect it with all services and connect AI at different stages, and not one, but several.

At the input of the AI agent are transactions, at the output is any reporting, and the Agent itself files taxes.

8. For example, modern accounting programs from Intuit are capable of keeping records in Quick-book and filing taxes through Turbo Tax, but the financial director and accountant communicate with this.

At the same time, Quickbook is integrated with all banks, i.e., receives all transactions in real-time, and TurboTax is integrated with the IRS. And between them is a person.

9. If it's a small business, then often the entrepreneur themselves files taxes. If it's medium-sized, then already several people, and here's 1000% certainty that within a couple of years 90% of accountants will be let go.

There will remain 2 (two) people — an accountant and a developer, and when Intuit rolls out its multi-agent system, both the accountant and the developer will be let go. Catching on? Great! Right?

**Then take another department. For example, marketing (sales) or HR, document flow, customer work and support, editorial.**

10. It won't happen immediately, of course. But gradually, some process will be transferred to the Agent, then more, more, and people will be let go. Inevitable, because the savings are monstrous, the quality is high, stability, and no unions.

11. This is already possible now, all the tools are there, i.e., anyone who has at least a little experience with no-code/low-code automation, built various funnels, integrations with Zapier/Make/n8n.io — they can already do this now, will learn very quickly. Why?

12. Because, for example, Open AI has already provided all the infrastructure, it's just that 99% of people don't know about it yet. They don't know that it's SO accessible.

In general, all this is good and very PROMISING, but there's one terrible problem that spoils the whole party, and about this in the next episode.
