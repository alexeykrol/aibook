When I first thought about the possibility of writing this book, my first idea was to make something like a manual, although I didn't really like it, because a manual is boring. And even in dialogues with the editor there was such a hint. And if you look around — a huge amount of literature is mainly manuals. But precisely the analysis of reviews, communication simply with a huge number of people, because the course now has almost 15 people, showed me that this is absolutely not the case. It turned out that people absolutely don't need manuals or knowledge. Why? Because it turned out that all people need is some hope, a motivational kick that will open the gates, and people are capable of learning anything themselves.

Especially teaches the fact that artificial intelligence is the best student on the planet. Of course, this book has quite a lot of practical moments, but the specificity is that I decided for a long time what to include in the book, what not to include. There's always a desire to include more in the book. But it turned out (and the course helped with this) that only a few key moments brought that very aha effect. Why? Because an explosion happens when you study for a short time, it takes you a long time and difficultly to understand — then this aha effect doesn't arise. And an explosion happens when suddenly they showed you some tiny little thing — and it just blew your mind, because you suddenly saw how many opportunities there are, and how you underestimated them, and all doubt immediately disappeared.

That is, this is such a specific trigger that turns you from a doubting skeptic into a passionate adept, literally a fanatic of faith. Not because someone convinced you of something — but they simply showed you, you tried for five seconds, and suddenly an abyss opened before you, understand? You went cold, you broke out in sweat, understand? Tears appeared in your eyes, because at this moment a miracle happens. Because suddenly all the ideas that came to your mind, perhaps for many, many years, which you couldn't implement for a million reasons — primarily because you didn't know how to do something, there was no time, no helpers, team, money and so on — suddenly all these minds woke up and told you: now you can. And you understand: yes, I can do this. You suddenly became a magician. And not because someone convinced you of this, but because you understand: yes.

And this happened only because you mastered several completely basic things. Because everything related to artificial intelligence is based on several basic things that I, in principle, described in this course. And I simply showed how I use them, just shared what I do. People have mind blown, understand? And it turned out that you don't need to write, stuff a lot into this book — it's enough to stuff basic things. Because this changes people's brains so much that they start to learn greedily, fanatically themselves, everywhere, wherever.

Because the whole paradigm of education until now was that you must find some expert, sign up for some crazy courses and so on. Yes, naturally, to a certain degree this exists. But when you suddenly mastered the basic things that I gave in the course, that I described in this book with artificial intelligence, you'll freeze everything, because you suddenly understand that you no longer need universities or courses — you need nothing. Because you already know how to do everything. You already know how to do everything. You can get an answer to any question — if not immediately, then ask again. Actually you understand that artificial intelligence is that very friend, mentor, teacher, through whom you can do anything, learn anything. This mentor will be with you until the end of life. It will never betray you.

Whatever all these idiots say about evil corporations and so on — they just don't know. It doesn't work like that. Nothing more powerful in all human history has existed. And you just need to reach out your hand. Just read this book. And not just read — everything is described step by step there, go in, do it. And you can do this in ChatGPT, you can do it in DeepSeek — there are quite a lot of them now, it's not fundamental at all now. Understand?

You can. Take this book, start reading there the first couple of chapters, start doing — it will take you 15 minutes. In 15 minutes your mind will just explode, understand? Your pressure will rise, your heart will start beating, you'll start salivating, you'll get holes — you'll need to sit down or lie down. I'm talking about this for sure, because before this it happened to me many times, before this it happened many times to a huge number of people. What is happening now is a revolution. But this revolution will be kind to those who believed and started moving.

And you don't need to be some alcoholic of faith, because you can check all this yourself. I always tell people: no need to believe — well take and check, what's the problem? It will take you several minutes. And, as a rule, everyone who is against this starts saying: "AI is dumb there". Guys, learn to use the tool, understand? If you were used to hammering nails with a microscope before, then the microscope is not to blame for this. Artificial intelligence is no different from a person in this. If you want to get a clear answer from a person, from an expert — just learn to ask questions correctly. This is a fundamental skill that is not related to artificial intelligence — it's related to life. But when you work with artificial intelligence, you hone this skill so much that you gradually learn to ask the right questions. And who do you think you start asking the most correct questions to? Artificial intelligence? No, my dears — you start asking them to yourself. And as soon as you start asking yourself the right questions, especially those you're not afraid of, you start getting answers that open doors that were simply closed before.
