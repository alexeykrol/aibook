For Whom This Book Is and Disclaimers

Yes, undoubtedly, artificial intelligence is obviously the strongest, most powerful innovation, and much more powerful than the invention of the wheel, sewage, even the internet and computer itself, and I have two pieces of news for you: good and bad.

The good news is that yes, indeed AI radically expands our capabilities. And most importantly — to realize these capabilities, no education is needed, nothing is needed. There are no specific conditions or obstacles that would prevent you from gaining these capabilities. Artificial intelligence is 100% democratically accessible to everyone, it's the new "great equalizer."

The bad news is that the only ones who can realize AI capabilities are people who have at least minimal ambitions, desire to grow, develop and learn. This is the only condition, it is both necessary and sufficient. The reverse is also true: even if you have excellent education, you're not stupid, but there's no internal ambition, there will be no use from artificial intelligence for you.

What conclusion from this? Obviously, artificial intelligence will sooner or later be implemented in practically all aspects of our life: from everyday to everything related to career, business, study, health. However, in this book we will NOT consider artificial intelligence from the point of view of how AI will change our life, because there's already a huge amount of speculation on this topic, and you can read science fiction.

In this book we will consider artificial intelligence exclusively from one point of view:

- what specific capabilities you get, that is, what you can now do and...

- how to really gain these capabilities.

Therefore - the first and only condition for getting capabilities - you must have ambitions. How old you are, what profession you have, what education you have, what you can or can't do, what religion you are, what your health status is, even if you're a 99-year-old elder living in the taiga - it doesn't matter. Nothing is an obstacle for you to radically change your life with AI help. Except fear and laziness, of course, but here the book will definitely help you. You'll meet a certain secret weapon there.

Accordingly, if for some reason you don't have ambitions, no desire to grow due to age or character, then, unfortunately, you won't be able to gain access to new capabilities. Such a paradox.

The reason for this bitter cataclysm is that artificial intelligence at the moment is the most powerful tool that humanity has invented. And therefore, like any tool, it must be mastered, learn to understand how to use it maximally, how exactly to gain access to God's capabilities. And like any learning, you must have a reason, motivation to make efforts, spend time. After all, you know - as a rule, success is achieved not by the smartest and most educated, but by the most motivated and persistent.

In general, you don't even need to make some special efforts, simply in fact we're talking NOT about artificial intelligence, about how to realize its capabilities, and you need to apply work to master them. And for this you need ambitions, minimal will, ability not to quit, which itself is very difficult. That's where the dog is buried.

Learning, growing is not about reading textbooks. It's about the ability not to quit, the ability to ask questions - sometimes simple, even stupid. The ability not to be afraid to look naive in other people's eyes. In some sense - the ability to remain a child, regardless of age. If you have all this, artificial intelligence opens a portal to another dimension for you. For those who have become too "adult" and "experienced," my personal opinion - artificial intelligence will give nothing, and rather take away. At minimum, a stable job in the near future.

Pragmatic conclusion: the book is intended exclusively for people who have at least small ambitions, ideas, desires to create or change something in their life. For those who have, in a good sense, "ants in their pants." These can be even the simplest things like the desire to earn money. Why not? The question here is not the quality of ambitions, but simply their presence in principle.

Practice shows that if you have ambitions and desire to grow, then even if ambitions are primitive, as you develop the level of your ambitions will grow. Maybe at first you just want to earn money and buy a better car, but who knows? Perhaps after some time you'll want, like Elon Musk, to create spaceships, explore the expanses of the Universe, search for cures for cancer or improve people's lives on the planet. The main thing is that you always have this thirst for growth, curiosity, desire to create. If you have it, the book will become a portal for you.

In fact, the book resembles a Quest. You enter the labyrinth, must find the right path, encounter puzzles, sometimes hit dead ends, but each time reach the door behind which is the next level. At the new level you have even more opportunities, but to get them, you need to pass another labyrinth. And as in any quest, there are prizes and rewards. The capabilities that artificial intelligence gives are prizes, but you need to try a little bit for them.

What is AI's main difference from everything that existed before its creation? Look, before the AI era, if you take your time spent on learning and compare it with the benefits you get, then one day of study gave almost nothing. You had to study for years and practice just as long to start meaning something. At least create something. What changed with AI's arrival?

Artificial intelligence gives a radically new level. Now, if you spend at least one day learning together with AI, you immediately get capabilities to really create something. The speed of learning and ability to create increase thousands of times. What used to require years now requires days.

And finally, the most inspiring - now, with AI's help you can create what in principle you couldn't before at all, because there wasn't enough time to learn, not enough resources, money, people. Now to learn you need hours and days, not years. You'll go a thousand times faster. Spend a day, maybe minutes or hours - and immediately get a result you couldn't even think about before.

In this book each chapter is a new level of your personal quest. I'll talk about new capabilities and about small, quite simple steps that don't require anything special to get results. The steps are simple, efforts are minimal, no special conditions or education needed, result - immediate. It doesn't matter if you're a programmer or not, technical or humanitarian. The main thing - desire, common sense and readiness to allocate a little time. Each chapter - new level of capabilities and steps that will need to be taken to advance. After all, as in any game, you can't get a prize without doing anything. Just the same in life: the bigger the prize, the more effort and deeper the path. Good news - you yourself determine how far you want to go and how fast. Someone will only slightly "dig," and their life will already change. And someone will want to go deeper - and transition to another reality.

The skeptical reader will immediately be wary: "Sounds tempting? And how to get such luxury in your hands? How to break the glass ceiling? You can promise anything. Sounds too incredible. How to try yourself, even a small thing, and immediately get a result, and so it's really 'Wow!'?"

I love skeptical readers, because they tend not to blindly believe but to think with their heads, so I always recommend: "Don't believe me. Believing, not believing - that's for priests, and I'm not a priest. Check with your practice. Believe your experience. Believe the results you achieve independently. I only show the way with an important caveat - this is not some general way, but how I go myself. With all the rare insights, even rarer successes and frequent failures. You can of course ask me - 'Do I know a more effective way?' Sorry, but I don't know. If you need guarantees, then apparently you should turn to happiness marathons.

So, let's figure it out. The main thing - your growth is a Quest. That's exactly how I wrote the book. Each chapter is a level of the Quest that you have to pass, and immediately the main question - why? What will I get from this?

Excellent question and passing a Quest level promises prizes. In our case, prizes are new capabilities that you get by passing the level. Capabilities to do what in principle you couldn't do or do something 1000 times faster and better. Essentially it's a Quest about how to become a wizard. The further you go, the more super skills, abilities you get. The more worlds and spaces become accessible to you. With each new level, a world opens for you that you had no chance to touch at all, even see with one eye.

And, as in any quest, to get prizes, you need to pass labyrinths, solve puzzles, pump up skills, grind a bit of useful resources, defeat bosses. Bad news - you can't get to the next level without passing the previous one, without solving all puzzles, without collecting magic artifacts and defeating the boss. That is, you can read, but you can't get inside, master super abilities. Why? Because magic is practice, not theory. Consider that AI is a Genie who can give you everything, but first you need to tame it and speak with it in one language. But don't worry, as in any Quest we'll start from the very beginning, simple level. Nevertheless, even passing only the 1st level - you'll already not just have your Genie, but it will do for you what 99% of the planet's population can't do. Yes, this is not a joke. Passing only the 1st level moves you into the select 1% of the population who are capable of talking with the Genie AI in its magic language, and a bit later you'll understand - how important it is to be able to pronounce the right spells (prompts), how powerful capabilities this opens.

So, **the main logic of the Quest:**

• **Level = new AI work skill** (Prompting, Research, projects, custom GPTs, automations, special services, data analysis, development and agents).

• **Reward = new capabilities and tasks** that you can now solve in different spheres (learning, career, business, health, creativity, etc.).

• **Labyrinths = specific tasks** that need to be passed to consolidate the level.

• **Diamonds = experience and new tools** that accumulate after passing.

• Without the skill of the previous level - you can't go further. As in a game: until you learned to prompt - Deep Research won't open; until you mastered projects - you can't build custom GPTs; until you understood automations - you won't create agents. That is, the book is structured as a **game journey**:

• Entrance: "You start as a beginner, you have only one tool - the ability to babble something in conversation with AI."

• Each level: "To go further, you need to master a new skill. Pass the trials, and new capabilities will open to you."

• End: "At the top - you control entire systems and agents. Before this was the domain of corporations, now it's accessible to you."

Now briefly - what awaits you?
