**Level 4. Custom GPTs — The Workshop of Executors**

You've learned to unite all efforts into projects, but a new enemy, a new Boss appears on the path — routine. It steals your days: the same explanations, monotonous letters, repetitive tasks. The Genie helps, but after a couple of dialogues it gets confused, and you have to start all over again.

**Your mission at this level** is to learn to focus AI for executing specific routine, frequently repeating tasks. For this, you create **Custom GPTs**: executors to whom you give instructions once, upload necessary materials — and then they stably do the work for you. At first glance, it seems this is just "another chat." But when you master this level, your life really begins to change, and you discover new magical superpowers:

**Your own expert in anything:** Previously, to understand an article, materials, textbook or course, you spent hours on independent searches or waited for explanations from a teacher. **Now:** You have your own expert in this topic, the textbook or program is loaded into it, and it answers only on this topic, quickly and to the point. It takes into account precisely the focus you set, not publicly available data. But that's not all. Now this expert can answer on the topic not only to you, but to everyone you share the link with. You have your own "teacher in a box" — instant answers on any topic and no time wasted. As many topics, as many teachers, experts you can create. All your colleagues, students, partners, clients can now ask questions to the teacher, consultant you created based on AI.

**Creating unique resumes for vacancies:** Previously, to adapt your resume to each vacancy, you manually edited the document, struggled with formulations and lost hours. Even if you used AI, you had to compose a new prompt each time. **Now there's no such problem** — a custom GPT with your resume and vacancy templates does this in a second. You send dozens of precise resumes where you previously managed to prepare one. Also, all your friends and colleagues can use the service you created. By the way, you can earn from it, since custom GPTs are available not only to you. You can give access to whomever you want. Now you have an advantage in speed and reach — you're playing with cheat codes.

**Business and work, working with texts, analysis:** Previously, routine responses to clients, commercial proposals, standard reports, letters, standard document analysis, FAQs, product descriptions took half the day from you or your team. If you used AI, again each time a new request. Minutes added up to hours. Now custom GPTs, trained on your templates and instructions, do this instantly. Now you have "virtual employees" who work without breaks, vacations and complaints. Now you have a "text conveyor" that works with one click.

Creating custom GPTs isn't just a skill, but a super-skill, because you've learned to create an executor who can perform thousands of different tasks. It's impossible to list them all, but in the chapter I'll give links to marketplaces and you'll be amazed — was it really possible to do this?

**Main Level 4 Reward:** Your life has changed. Routine tasks with standard conditions and actions that took hours and energy now take seconds. You've won time — entire days and weeks. This time can be lived for real: be with loved ones, finally finish watching a series, get under a blanket with a book or do those things you always postponed. Moreover, now you can delegate these tasks to anyone, hire a cheap executor who will only load data, while AI does the complex work. And most importantly — you don't need to come up with a complex prompt anew, now your prompt works again and again. AI takes routine upon itself. And you get your life back. You package complexity into simple data input and immediate results. This must be felt once.

You defeated a very strong Boss — routine. Standard tasks haven't disappeared, it's just that now you spend not hours but seconds on them. And now you can delegate them to those who can't do anything. And that's fine, AI does everything. What awaits you next?
