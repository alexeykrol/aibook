**Level 6. Specialized Services — The Master's Arsenal**

After automations, you've stepped into a new world. But a new enemy rises before you — narrow tasks requiring dozens of different competencies: graphics, video, music, visualization. Previously, this required specialists, agencies and long months of training.

**The level's enemy** — fragmented tools and skill barriers. Each service lived by itself, and without a team or big budget you found yourself limited.

**Your mission** is to master an arsenal of specialized AI services. Here neural networks themselves draw paintings, edit videos, create music and turn data into infographics. Now the workshop is open in all directions at once: you work like an entire studio. And rewards await you — in various spheres of life and work.

**Creativity: paintings, clips, soundtracks, 3D graphics:** Previously: artistic projects hit budget and executor limits. To create a painting — you need an artist, to record a song — a studio and musicians, to shoot a clip — an operator, editor and an entire team. Such projects took weeks or months and were expensive. Now: AI services like Midjourney, Runway, Suno and dozens of others allow creating art objects of professional level literally in hours. It's enough to describe an idea — and the neural network turns it into a painting, music track or video. Everyone gets the opportunity to try on the role of film director, artist or music producer — without special education and a team. Ideas no longer wait for investments and connections: they immediately take form. Creativity becomes accessible, and quality — comparable to professional.

**Business: advertising and marketing** Previously: agencies dragged out deadlines and charged dearly for banners and videos. Now: you write a short brief, and AI makes adaptive creatives for social networks, websites and offline advertising. The campaign launches the same day.

**Career: portfolio and self-presentation.** Previously: assembling a portfolio for a designer, musician or videographer was a task for months. Now: services help quickly create work collections, covers and demo tracks. You always have fresh materials at hand for growth.

**Science and education: visualization and infographics.** Previously: complex graphs and diagrams required mastery of Excel, Illustrator or code. Now: specialized AI automatically turns tables and data into understandable infographics and visual diagrams. The complex becomes simple for explanation and teaching.

**Blogging and social networks: visual posts, videos and stories:** Previously: to make an impressive post, you had to figure out Photoshop, edit video in Premiere, select music and fonts. This required time, skills and often a separate designer or editor. Now: AI tools take on all the routine. Just upload text or an idea — and the service itself selects style, creates illustrations, generates short videos, overlays music and animation. Even Instagram stories or TikTok videos can be assembled automatically, and then just choose the option you like. As a result, media content is created literally "with one click": from idea to ready visual takes not hours or days, but minutes. This opens access to professional-level design for any blogger — without experience and without budget for a team.

**Main Level 6 Reward:** Now specialized skills no longer limit your projects. You have in your hands an entire arsenal of services: each idea immediately gets the form of a painting, video, music or infographic. You no longer depend on others' competencies and can launch projects entirely yourself. You've received the key — the Master's Arsenal. And if you pass this level, new treasures will open to you — the ability to create media products that previously required teams and months of labor.

Alas, starting from the previous level, you'll be fighting with one and the same Boss who waits on all paths of growth, guards the way to higher magic. This Boss has one name — the desire to quit, stop at what's been achieved. Only will, the ability not to quit, to figure things out, learn, not stop at what's been achieved — give a chance at victory, but you'll have helpers. They live on the book's pages and beyond, won't do anything for you, but will definitely strengthen you in the battle with learned helplessness.
