2. Preparation. Registration, Free and Paid Versions, How to Start?

I advise considering AI as a sentient starship with which you'll journey through the Quest and explore new worlds together. You may not believe this now, but AI will be with you for life, developing alongside you, becoming a key partner, so let's start with service registration. How to register?

In practice, you can visit <https://chatgpt.com/> through different browsers and VPNs without registration. If connecting through VPN, the service may request confirmation, but after that access opens.

Even without an account, basic features are available, including text and voice input. You can interact with ChatGPT, which supports Russian language and allows dialogue via text or voice - you ask, AI responds - very convenient, especially in the mobile ChatGPT app. Now voice mode is available in practically all market AIs, as are mobile apps for iPhone and Android. However, if you don't register, you have no more than 3-5% of the main functionality, due to absence of personalization and saved request history (which is super useful).

**Important!** AI can teach us faster and more effectively than humans. AI is available 24/7, doesn't get irritated, doesn't get offended, and provides the opportunity to ask questions without fear of looking stupid. If an answer is unclear, you can clarify details, and in complex topics like quantum mechanics, AI allows learning tens of times faster than traditional methods. Therefore, it's worth getting maximum access, which opens with registration.

During registration, the system requests name, date of birth and offers to familiarize yourself with the usage policy. Immediately after registration, basic functions open, which we'll discuss in detail later. Information you entered during registration can be edited at any moment.

**Free and Paid Versions?**

For beginners, in 80% of cases free access covers all needs, but if deeper topic development is needed, paid subscription becomes a super useful tool. Believe me, $20 per month is a negligible fee compared to the opportunities it opens. The difference between free and paid tiers is enormous.

| **Option / Criterion** | **Free** | **Plus ($20/month)** | **Pro ($200/month)** |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Price | $0 per month. | $20 per month. | $200 per month. Officially positioned as "full access to the best of ChatGPT". |
| Brain (access to top model) | Access to GPT-5 (flagship model), but with limitations on number of requests and without priority guarantee. GPT-5 is described as an expert-level model, greatly improved in logic, code and hallucination reduction. | Access to GPT-5 with "advanced reasoning", meaning expanded logic, plus access to other reasoning modes. Same class of models, but you get more computational budget. | "Pro reasoning with GPT-5" / "GPT-5 pro mode": model can "think longer" and use more computation per answer. This is positioned as maximum intelligence available in the product. |
| Message limit with top model | Up to ~10 messages with GPT-5 every ~5 hours. After that you're automatically switched to "mini" model variant until limit refreshes. | Up to 160 messages with GPT-5 every 3 hours (temporary increase from previous 80/3h). After limit exhaustion, you're transferred to "mini" until window resets. This is announced as temporary increase and "may be rolled back". | "Unlimited messages and uploads" with GPT-5 and access to Pro mode. Wording: no limits, subject to fair use / priority traffic. That is, officially - no ceiling in normal workload. |
| Message limit in other models (old/fast models) | They give simplified and "mini" models almost without caps after you hit GPT-5 limit. | Plus users usually see separate caps for different models (approximately: ~80 messages / 3 hours for GPT-4o, ~40 for GPT-4, weekly caps for heavy reasoning models). Numbers were published by OpenAI in help/support. | Pro declares "unlimited access to GPT-5 and select legacy models", meaning effectively without these separate small ceilings. |
| Image generation (DALL·E / Image / Vision-to-Image) | Limited: approximately several (couple of) image generations per day, and speed is lower. These are unofficial public limits, Free doesn't get GPU priority. | Approximately up to ~50 images per 3 hours. There's accelerated generation and "expanded and faster image creation" according to tier description. | "Unlimited and faster image creation": formally no ceiling in normal load, plus highest priority for generation. |
| File upload / work with files | File upload exists, but limits are low: you hit something faster (number of files and context window size). Numbers for Free not publicly disclosed. | Limits on order of ~80 files per 3-hour window and dozens of images in same window were published. Plus also gives file analysis, tables, etc. without extra charge. | Pro declared as "Unlimited messages and uploads", meaning ceilings on uploads and file analysis are effectively removed for real work (only fair use remains). |
| Context and memory (how much it remembers and holds in mind) | Memory (long-term remembering about you) available in limited form; context volume is limited. Context windows were announced at level of tens of thousands of tokens for free access, but not all memory functionality is enabled. | Plus gives "expanded memory and context": more long-term chat memory and more context tokens (publicly mentioned windows up to ~128k tokens and storing large files within session). | Pro gives "maximum memory and context": marketing states as maximum possible context and memory + "GPT-5 pro mode", meaning model can think longer (more compute) over your task. |
| Deep Research / agentic mode (model independently researches web, goes through steps, calls tools) | In free plan there's access to web search and basic Deep Research version, but this is cut by usage limits and can temporarily disable after you burn through heavy model limit. | "Expanded deep research and agent mode": Plus gets expanded Deep Research (long investigations, step chains, internet and uploaded document search), and this doesn't shut down as quickly. | "Maximum deep research and agent mode": Pro gets maximum budgets for these agentic runs, so AI can independently navigate web, documents, tools. Positioned as level for serious work. |
| Speed / Priority | Normal speed. During peak load hours there may be delays or even refusal "model is currently overloaded". | Fast responses and "priority access", meaning you're not as easily cut by queue. This is noticeable on heavy models (code, reasoning, images). | Pro gets "prioritized traffic and no peak hour limits", meaning you're effectively not throttled during peak: minimal interruptions, top queue. |
| Voice / video / screen sharing | Voice mode exists (including phone access in US up to ~15 minutes per month on 1-800-CHATGPT), but without screen/video quality guarantees. This is made as demo feature for wide audience. | Plus gives full-featured voice mode, video mode and screen sharing right in chat (called Voice / Screenshare / Realtime). This is already tool type "call with AI", not just text. | Pro gives "unlimited access to advanced voice", with increased limits on video and screen sharing, meaning effectively long live assistant sessions. |
| Video generation (Sora 1) | No access to Sora 1 (video generation). | "Limited access to Sora 1 video generation" - limited number of renders/clips. Numbers not publicly disclosed, but access exists. | "Extended access to Sora 1 video generation" - more minutes/video clips, early access to new capabilities. |
| Own custom GPTs, projects, tasks | Free: you can run ready GPTs and work with projects, but without guarantee of storing large workspaces and without team features. | Plus: "Projects, tasks and custom GPTs" - meaning you can maintain your workspaces, save custom assistants for different tasks, organize to-dos and pipelines right inside. | Pro: "Expanded projects, tasks and custom GPTs" - same thing, but without small ceilings on number of tasks/agents; plus early access to integrations like Gmail / Calendar search right in chat (this is currently rolled out to Pro first). |
| Integrations with external services (email, calendar, files) | In Free this is almost absent: you can't fully connect Gmail/Calendar/Drive and search through them in dialogue. | For Plus this is announced as part of ecosystem (file access, document analysis), but integrations like "read my email now" are rolled out gradually and with limitations. | Pro currently gets priority early access to tight integrations (for example, Gmail and Calendar search right inside chat). This is emphasized as Pro-only feature at launch. |
| For whom | "I write less often, I just need smart assistant sometimes." Costs nothing, but frequent limits and slower. | "I work with AI every day: text, code, tables, presentations, research. Want stability and speed for minimal money." This is typical creator/freelancer/analyst. | "I live inside AI and want maximum power, without caps, with integration into work processes, with priority even during peak load." This is consulting, R&D, production workflow. |

Key things important to understand as a "beginner":

1. Message limit - this is the main "safety valve" for OpenAI. Free: about 10 GPT-5 messages per ~5 hours. Plus: up to 160 per 3 hours (temporarily doubled). Pro: declared "unlimited" for real load, meaning you're almost never cut.
2. In Pro the model really has more "thinking time" per answer (pro mode). This means not just faster, but deeper. This is directly stated as "uses more compute to think harder".
3. Plus already gives normal working level: many messages, fast responses, file analysis, pictures, voice/video mode, Deep Research. Therefore $20/month is the threshold after which AI becomes a real working assistant, not just a toy.
4. Pro - this isn't "a bit better". This is a separate class: unlimited, hardware priority, voice as full-fledged call, early integrations (email, calendar, documents), and expanded video generation access (Sora 1). This is made for people whose AI is a central working tool.

- If you just need smart help sometimes → Free is enough.

- If you really work through AI (writing, code, research, tasks) → Plus.

- If you want maximum computational power, almost no ceilings, early access and production load → that's Pro.

**Try it:** Register, confirm email, then go to Settings - bottom left, and click Upgrade plan, choose Plus. You should have a card ready in advance that you can pay with - **take care of this in advance**. You can also pay using Apple Pay.
