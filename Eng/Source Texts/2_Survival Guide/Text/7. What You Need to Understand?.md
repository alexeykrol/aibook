7. What You Need to Understand?

The truth is that artificial intelligence behaves completely differently for different people. For some, it seems to them, it's stupid, gives inadequate results, lies, adapts, flatters. In general, people struggle with it, get disappointed, consider it a completely useless thing.

But at the same time there's a mass of people - I belong to them - who consider artificial intelligence the most powerful, effective tool ever created in human history. And the second group of people gets absolutely fantastic results, opens incredible opportunities and does amazing things that were simply impossible to realize before.

The entire difference between these groups is only in mastering the skill of interacting with artificial intelligence: how to come up with prompts, how to manage context and so on. And, of course, you can say that this entire book is largely devoted precisely to this - creating prompts for solving the most diverse tasks: from simple to complex, requiring reflection, analysis, data collection and so on.

Moreover, in both simple and complex tasks you can give unsuccessful, weak prompts and get corresponding, pathetic results. But as soon as you start understanding how the model works, how its principles are structured, look at examples, approaches, study methodology - and it, by the way, is not difficult, we'll examine all this in detail - a new reality literally opens up before you.

Over the past year, probably more than 40 thousand people have gone through my courses. You can look at the statistics - I'm talking about free courses that are made for people to use, not counting that I have quite a lot of subscribers - more than 100 thousand at the moment, and this number is growing rapidly. Artificial intelligence is currently the main topic I write about.

That is, I receive gigantic volumes of feedback, and I want to emphasize once again: when it seems to you that AI is "being stupid" or behaving strangely - believe me, in 98% of cases the problem is not in artificial intelligence, but in the fact that you don't know how to work with it. This, by the way, applies to developers and IT specialists. It would seem these people should better understand how artificial intelligence works, how to effectively interact with it. However, this is not always the case. Because deep psychology that defines personality - how a person learns, how they perceive innovations - is not connected to profession in any way.

Now there's a gigantic gap between those who show curiosity, learn, don't judge, figure things out, constantly look for answers to the question "how to do better, more effectively, more practically", - and those who don't do this. Curious people are taking off, and at the same time there remains a mass of quite professional people - including developers and programmers, those who supposedly work in the industry, - but for some reasons they have prejudices. They lag terribly behind, stubbornly refuse to accept AI, considering themselves the smartest in the room. It's sad, but we won't discuss this.

Everyone makes their choice. And this choice determines your life, fate, success, growth. Don't be lazy. Have an open mind, curiosity. Make mistakes, learn from your mistakes - and nothing will be impossible for you. AI is here to help you. Well, and the Force, of course.
