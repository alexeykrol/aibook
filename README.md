## 📖 About the Book

This is not just a book about artificial intelligence — it's a **quest**, where each chapter unlocks a new level of possibilities.

### Main Idea

**"Now You Can!"** — you don't need to be a programmer, have special education, or spend years learning. With AI, you can start creating in just a few days, not years.

### Who is this book for?

✅ For those who have **ambition and desire to grow**
✅ Regardless of age, gender, profession, or education
✅ For those who are ready to learn and experiment
✅ For skeptics who want to **verify**, not just believe

❌ Not for those who expect guarantees without effort

## ⚙️ Book Development Methodology

### How is this book created?

This book is developed using **software development** methodology, utilizing tools typically used for creating software:

- **GitHub** — version control, team collaboration, main branch protection
- **VS Code** — text editor
- **Claude Code (Codex MAX)** — AI agent as a super-assistant

### Division of Roles: Author and AI

#### 👤 Author writes the text

**Important:** All book text is written by a human. AI does **NOT** write and does **NOT** edit artistic or authorial texts.

#### 🤖 AI — powerful assistant for tasks that AI handles better and faster

**80% of a responsible writer's work** is not writing text, but:

##### ✅ What AI does:
- **Analysis and structuring** — examining plot lines, intersections, mentions
- **Fact-checking** — verifying historical facts, dates, events
- **Research** — searching for information, quotes, references
- **Logic control** — finding logical bombs and contradictions
- **Lore management** — storing the entire context database, characters, events
- **Character development** — analyzing motivations, character arcs, connections
- **Assembly and organization** — managing project structure, scenes, chapters

##### ❌ What AI does NOT do:
- Does not write authorial text
- Does not edit artistic descriptions
- Does not make creative decisions

### Why specifically agentic AI?

Not just chatbots are used, but **code agents** (Claude Code), which:
- Work with file structure as a project
- Use git for version control
- Analyze the entire context of the book as a whole
- Can perform complex multi-stage tasks autonomously

### Result: 50x Speed Increase

When writing books in genres requiring:
- Factology (historical works, biographies)
- Complex plot structures (series, franchises)
- Multiple intersecting storylines (movie scripts, action)

**Research and analytical work** is accelerated by **50 times**, freeing the author for **creativity**.
