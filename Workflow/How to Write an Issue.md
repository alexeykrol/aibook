How to Write an Issue — Mini Guide

1) Describe the problem, not the emotion

What to do: one sentence describing what doesn't work / what's unclear.
Weak point: people often write "nothing works" — this is useless.

2) Provide minimal context

What to do: where you came from, what you expected, what you got.
Example: "In file X, function Y should return Z, but returns Q".
Weak point: excessive details turn the issue into a novel.

3) Steps to reproduce

What to do: 3–5 specific actions to repeat the bug.
Weak point: without this, others can't verify the problem.

4) Actual vs expected behavior

Clearly separate:
	•	Expected: …
	•	Got: …
Weak point: people often confuse "expected" with "should be this way" — that's not a fact.

5) Minimal example / screenshot / log

Only what's necessary.
Weak point: too many logs = nobody reads them.

6) Suspected cause (optional)

If you have a hypothesis — mark it as possible, so as not to mislead.
Weak point: confident but incorrect conclusions from the author confuse the track.

7) Definition of Done

Briefly: how we'll know the task is solved.
This protects against "fixed, but not what was needed".
