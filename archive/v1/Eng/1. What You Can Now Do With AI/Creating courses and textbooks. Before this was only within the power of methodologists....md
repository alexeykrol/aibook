* **Creating courses and textbooks.** Before this was only within the power of methodologists and experienced teachers. Now you can assemble a complete course with assignments, tests, and lesson plans in days.
* **Personnel and staff training.** What used to require an HR department and complex tools is now available to anyone: competency assessment, development program creation, and feedback collection.

**Creativity**

The most radical shift has happened here:

* **Music.** Before, composing music required knowledge and instruments. Now any person can create songs, arrangements, and even symphonies.
* **Visual creativity.** Before, only artists and designers could draw illustrations or 3D models. Now you can get professional-quality results in minutes.
* **Video and cinema.** Before, cinema required millions of dollars, teams of specialists, and studios. Now one person can create a film with graphics and editing comparable to professional production.

**Work**

* **Task automation.** Automation has existed for decades but was only available to programmers and engineers. With AI, now any person can assign routine processes to machines — from document processing to business process management.
* **Project management.** Before this required complex tools and experience. Now AI itself formalizes tasks, monitors deadlines, and helps predict risks.
* **Household tasks and smart home.** Before home automation was expensive and complex. Now you can control lighting, climate, and everyday life with simple words.
* **Robotics and drones.** Before engineers were needed. Now you can assign tasks and analyze data from drones and robots without special knowledge.

**Business**

* **Marketing and advertising.** Before agencies and budgets were needed. Now you can develop strategies, texts, and campaigns yourself.
* **Sales and customers.** Before effective scripts and CRM systems were only available to companies. Now all this can be done individually.

* **Manufacturing.** Before production planning was a complex task for entire departments. Now you can optimize inventory and capacity with AI help.
* **Transportation.** Before routes and logistics required specialists. Now routing and forecasting are available to everyone.
* **Agriculture.** Before agricultural technologies required devices and experts. Now crop forecasting and soil analysis can be obtained immediately.
* **Energy and climate.** Before this was only available to research centers. Now you can forecast loads and model scenarios right at the personal level.

**Science and Research**

* **Search and explanation of phenomena.** Before understanding complex processes required years of preparation. Now you can quickly get a detailed explanation based on sources.
* **Research.** Before reviewing dozens of sources required months. Now this can be done in days and get systematic analysis.
* **Compression and reports.** Before analyzing data arrays required entire teams. Now you can automatically collect summaries and reviews.
* **Science.** Before modeling and simulations were only available to research institutes. Now any person can propose hypotheses and test them.
* **Engineering.** Before designing structures required years of study and expensive programs. Now you can create optimized models with AI help.
* **Construction.** Before design and calculations were the domain of architectural firms. Now you can independently plan and evaluate projects.

**Texts and Information**

* **Image analysis.** Before photo analysis required experts. Now you can upload a picture and get a complete breakdown.
* **Data extraction.** Before extracting data from documents was a long and limited process. Now this can be done instantly.
* **Knowledge management.** Before systematizing knowledge required discipline and special methodologies. Now this has become simple and fast.

**Security**

* **Cybersecurity.** Before log and event analysis was the domain of specialists. Now you can see suspicious actions and protect data yourself.

**Information Technology**

* **System management.** Before supporting complex processes was only available to professionals. Now you can control system operation without special knowledge.
