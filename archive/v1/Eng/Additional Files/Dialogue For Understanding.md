Dialogue for Understanding

Me: Everything is fine, but the final document is again just a list. But remember, the key format of the document:

Learning

Before: To master a profession, language or new skill, you needed years of study, courses, tutors, discipline and money. You depended on schedules and other people's capabilities.
Now: With AI you can learn thousands of times faster: what used to take years now fits into weeks or even days. You have a personal professor available 24/7, who never gets tired and is always ready to explain until it becomes clear.
This is not just "learning at a comfortable pace" — this is a radical change. You no longer wait for a semester to master a course. You take and do. This is not a 10% acceleration — this is a 1000-fold leap. AI turns learning from a long path into an instant sprint.

Teaching

Before: To create a textbook or course, you needed several months of work by an entire team of authors, methodologists and editors. It was a slow, expensive and complex process.
Now: With AI you can assemble a complete course with tests, assignments and a textbook in one day. What used to be done by dozens of people in six months is now done by one person with AI in hours.
And this is not just acceleration. This is complete removal of the barrier. Before you had to be an expert and author, now an idea and intention are enough. AI turns your thought into a finished product. You don't search for specialists, don't wait for months — you create immediately. This is a revolution in teaching: from impossible to accessible to everyone.

Career

Before: Job searching was a painful marathon: manually reviewing hundreds of vacancies, adapting resumes, writing letters, waiting for responses. For strategies and analysis you needed coaches and career consultants.
Now: AI analyzes tens of thousands of vacancies in minutes, selects the most relevant ones, writes custom resumes for each, prepares cover letters and tracks responses. This is work that a person couldn't complete in a lifetime, now available to everyone.
And this is not just convenience. This is removal of physical limitations. You're no longer limited by time of day or number of vacancies you can process. AI does this instantly and without fatigue. Now you have a competitive advantage you couldn't dream of before: instead of one attempt you have hundreds and thousands. You direct — AI does. This is a new level of career that was previously unattainable.

I.e., you need to merge these two formats.

I.e., on one hand the Quest structure, as in the current version, but not boring and dry:

Rewards:

Learning: 24/7 explanations on any topic.

Texts: articles, letters, notes.

Career: interview preparation.

Health: deciphering medical terms.

Creativity: first poems and pictures.

But in the format

[The dialogue continues with the AI proposing a merged format combining Quest structure with dramatic "Before/Now" narratives, ending with establishing a template for describing each Quest level...]
