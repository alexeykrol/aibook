**General prompt-template** by which I should describe each Quest level, taking into account all your edits:

⸻

🎭 **Level Description Template**

**1. Header**

• "Level N. [Name] — [Image/Metaphor]"

• The name should give both the functionality ("Custom GPTs", "Automations") and the sense of adventure ("Tower of Creation", "Workshop of Executors").

**2. Introduction (Setup + Drama)**

• "You've reached..." / "Now before you..."

• Description of the hero's state: what they want, what problems they face.

• Enemy of the level: chaos, routine, distraction, slowness, fatigue, overload, etc.

• Formulation of the mission: "You're about to..."

👉 Here we keep balance between metaphor and reality: at early levels — bright mythology (genies, gates, labyrinths), at later levels — more business style ("data chaos", "process overload").

**3. Main rewards (spheres of activity)**

• Described as **"Before / Now"**:

• Before: long, hard, expensive, slow, through people.

• Now: fast, immediately, accessible, without intermediaries.

• Each reward presented as **magical art / artifact / new tool**, but as levels grow — everything becomes drier and more business-like.

• Focus not on the tool ("GPT can"), but on **how the hero's life has changed**: control, speed, clarity, freedom, time, calm.

**4. Level finale (Main reward)**

• Always one strong thought: **main change in the hero's life**.

• Not "you built a tool", but "your life has now become such-and-such".

• Examples:

• Level 1 → "Now you have a language of communication with the Genie, and for the first time you see that the world obeys your words".

• Level 3 → "Now everything is in the system, AI holds all context, chaos has disappeared, anxiety has gone".

• Level 4 → "Now routine takes seconds, and you have hours and days for life".

**5. Transition to the next level**

• "You received the key..." / "Now you have a tool to go further..."

⸻

📌 **Main principle:**

Each level = drama + game mechanics, but focus is always on **rewards and hero's transformation**. The reader should want not to "pass the level", but to "take the treasure".

⸻

Do you want me to immediately rewrite **Level 2** (Research) according to this template, so we have 1-4 already built in a unified style?
