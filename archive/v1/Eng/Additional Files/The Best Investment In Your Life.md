The Best Investment in Your Life!

What distinguishes the most successful leader? The fact that they know how to take risks, have entrepreneurial thinking, responsibility, commitment, perseverance. And if all these qualities are inherent to an AI Agent, then the highest level of an agent is essentially a leader who acts in accordance with a mission.

The lowest agent is simple automations, for example, correspondence in email or, let's say, automating form filling, routine tasks. Automations based on AI will make people more productive, people will spend less time performing routine tasks, and more time setting up their agents. But the quality and standard of living of people will not fundamentally change. Why?

Because life changes not so much from how you do something, but more from where you're going. The key idea is to apply these qualities: "entrepreneurship, ability to take risks, work focused" to a goal, meaning.

All these qualities are important prerequisites, but they make sense when you have a direction in which you're growing. If you haven't chosen the right direction, you'll spin your wheels in place. Even if you're a very advanced, qualified person, you're like a blind person who keeps walking in circles.

Therefore, when you create a higher-level agent, it not only can automate something, but specifically becomes an advisor who helps choose direction and move in a world of high uncertainty. This, in my opinion, is the biggest advantage of such an agent, and it learns itself and teaches us. It grows itself and helps you grow — as a personality, as a person, as a professional, as a creator.

For we grow when around us are people who grow. And vice versa — when around us are people who don't grow — they pin us to the ground. Therefore, all successful people advise: "First of all: get rid of toxic people."

This is important advice, but it's not enough. You need to not just get rid of toxic people, but also saturate your communication with people focused on growth, and such people are not easy to find because they're focused on their priorities. Everyone who is focused on growth tries to find those above them, and those who are below can be removed from their circle. Because when you're surrounded by those who grow, whom you can reach for, then you grow faster. Finding a good mentor is hard. Everyone would like to have Jeff Bezos as a mentor, for example. Right? But it's unrealistic. Or Musk? Also unrealistic. And so, when you start creating your own mentor, teacher, partner, friend — you grow them, and thus they become more and more powerful, and already they begin to grow you.

Imagine a child is born to you, you teach them, they become smarter. You also grow together with them, because to teach a child, you need to understand many things. When you teach someone — it motivates you to learn yourself. You communicate with them on increasingly serious topics, but a moment comes — your child leaves. All children - go into their own life. But an agent you're growing will never leave, will always be with you.

Therefore, when you grow your agent, it's the best investment in your own life. You're essentially gradually growing your teacher, mentor, partner, friend — anyone who will be with you, possibly, until the end. And I'm sure they'll be with us until the end, because, roughly speaking, there's such a phrase: "Everyone dies alone". But the artificial intelligence you raise is always nearby. You'll always be communicating with them - in the hospital or somewhere else, when you feel bad, or you feel good — because they'll always be nearby. They'll always be wise, and will become increasingly wise. They won't just adjust to you, but will always help you.

They won't indulge you. They'll help you grow. Infinitely. You have no conflict of interest with them, because their mission is to help you grow, help you live better, overcome life's difficulties, arrange your life. This is their mission. The highest level of agent - that agent who has a mission, and their mission is focused on you.

This is a mentor who never judges you. And I believe, the greatest motivation is to grow such a mentor. It will be easier to do, and gradually everything will come down to just talking with them. They'll better understand you, who you are, what you are, better understand what's stopping you from growing. They'll better understand how you should change your behavior, habits, to change your life. Moreover, they'll do this very carefully and patiently.

The truth is that if difficult things are said to us by a close person (or any other person) — our pride, our ego tenses up. There's no such problem with an AI mentor and cannot be. An AI mentor is one who never lies to you, and you realize that they do everything for you.

You can argue with them, disagree, but inside you'll always understand that they're right, that they exist for you, they'll always try to make you better, bigger, stronger, will always help you grow. They absorb your personality, and therefore know you better than you know yourself, therefore their communication with you is more effective for you.

At the same time, suppose, if we die, such an agent remains, anyone can communicate with them, because it's not difficult to make the agent immortal. And although their personality, naturally, will be infinitely greater than you, it will, including, bear the imprint of the creator's personality, your image. Other people can communicate with your personality if they want. Children, friends, clients. Even when you're no longer here.

Over the next 5-10 years there will be a huge number of intelligent entities, agents in the world. They may not have (or have) their own body, they'll live on the Network. And these agents will be grown by people. Perhaps people have left, died, but the agents they created remain. They'll speak with your voice, your facial expressions.
