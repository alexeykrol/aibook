The Second Civilization.

For example, when we make some automation for ourselves, it's completely closed. But as increasingly intelligent agents begin to appear that will go out to the internet to collect information, make some decisions, — inevitably they will reach such a level when passively collecting information, as some Deep Research, ChatGPT does now, will not be enough.

AI agents will go out not to websites, but to agents that represent these projects. Well, I'll explain what's the matter. That is, now the front-end of any project, any company is some website. And now imagine that the front-end of a project becomes not a website, but also an AI agent, special artificial intelligence, whose task is to answer questions from everyone who shows interest in this project, this corporation, this organization and so on. That is, our communications don't happen in graphical textual form, as now on a website, not through primitive bots.

At a new level, communications become more natural. For example, when I meet such a gatekeeper, conventionally speaking, artificial intelligence, and say to them: "Explain to me briefly what you're doing here, and how this can help me?" — "What do you need?" they'll answer, and we have communication with AI. They're smart, not as stupid as bots now and they really immediately give what's needed.

And imagine that at a certain stage not people, but other agents will start turning to such a sales person. That is, roughly speaking, when an agent wants to get some information, they can try not just to scan or parse, or scrape a website, as it happens now. AI agents will start communicating with each other, because it's more effective than a website.

This changes the paradigm of creating websites, because if until the current time websites were made for people and search engines, then from some moment websites will start being made for AI agents. How to make websites of a different level, where the core of the website is artificial intelligence that answers questions? Actually an assistant, but not for support service, but replacing sales.

Gradually more and more AI agents created by us will go online and communicate with other AI agents. This is a NEW internet - not for people, but for AI agents who act on behalf of and at the behest of people. Agents can not only communicate, but negotiate, do joint projects, unite into groups, into communities, organizations, whose members will be artificial intelligences. Why will they unite? Because each of them has a mission, each of them has some goal, some resources, and they can, communicating with each other, find out that it's expedient to cooperate, negotiate, divide their functions, tasks, like people. Crypto is a native environment for AI agents, since it's completely electronic money for all sorts of transactions, any NFTs.

Can AI agents harm a person? I think people will be behind them, and people can always have a conflict of interest. Accordingly, inevitably, at some stage artificial intelligence will become a weapon of sorts. All this story will give a completely new meaning to our life.

As more and more people want to create their agents, they will first have primitive tools — like Character AI and so on, right. But gradually people will want serious agents. And then the question will arise: who will teach these agents? Because people understand that they themselves cannot teach — they don't have time, competencies for this.

We strive to give a child to a good teacher. Just like we want to give our agent to a good teacher. Artificial intelligence that teaches artificial intelligences to be smart — this can be a very cool business.
