**Key Questions**

— What is this beast called an AI-based Agent, or AI agent?
— How does an AI agent differ from familiar chats like chatGPT?
— How does an AI agent differ from using a model like GPT-4 in API access mode?

**The most important question.**

1. What can an AI agent do that chatGPT (any chat with LLM) cannot, and what cannot be done using dumb one-shot API calls?
2. What can we do with an AI agent? How does this change our lives — not programmers, but ordinary people?
3. How can you create an AI agent without any code, hassle, or technical knowledge, and is it possible? (Spoiler — yes). And most importantly — DO WE NEED IT?

That is, in the simplest form, the important question sounds like this:

**Part 1: Self-Identification.**

I, for example, am a harsh Siberian plumber, a cheerful cosmetologist, a modest starship pilot, not to mention all sorts of marketers, SMM managers, bloggers, coaches, info-hustlers, Tarot specialists, and other humanities people, editors, clerks, teachers, traders, crypto folks, in general, plankton.

**Part 2: The Question.**

And why the hell do I need this AI agent? How will it help me earn money or, at worst, just ease my battle with bleak reality? Is it worth spending precious time to understand what this is and how to get it, buy it, rent it, make it, steal it, and make it work instead of me? Will it pay for itself or is this another hype (how tired we are of them all?)

As a result, I'm very, very lazy, so almost 50 years ago I realized that:

thinking and looking for an answer to any question is faster and easier than trying to understand someone else's shitcode, I mean, what people who can't express themselves and think clearly have invented.

Outcome:

1. Imagine you need an executor who will perform NOT ONE action (like answering a question in a dialogue), but A TON of actions, and WITHOUT YOUR participation. You give them a list of tasks, activities, some of your comments, and that's it — go ahead, do your thing! Like a super home helper, but also files your taxes, or negotiates with clients, answers letters — SMARTLY. And this helper is AI, but!!!

2. You don't want to have endless conversations with AI all the time so it does routine actions instead of you, because explaining to it each time or even using something like GPTs is annoying. No — you don't want that.

3. You have a long instruction with a ton of items, and YOU WANT the AI agent to do ALL these actions WITHOUT your participation, moreover, to understand, act flexibly, adapt to the situation, and not mess with your brain.

That is, you need a SMART executor to whom you outline the goal (criteria for achieving it), and they themselves will do everything necessary, get everything, figure it out, and only bother you if they encounter a situation where they don't have instructions.

Like "should I pay this dude or tell him to f*** off? And in what cases to pay, and when not?" Or like "Should I bring taxes to zero in the accounting report or throw 5 cents to the tax office?", etc.

And chatGPT is not capable of such tasks, and a simple dialogue through API is also not capable. But this AI agent is capable.

What does this mean in practical terms? How to get such luxury? In the next episode.
