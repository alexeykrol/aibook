**What is the Difference Between a Real AI Agent and AI Assistant? Why Do You Need an Agent?**

An assistant is just chatGPT, i.e. a one-time action, you constantly need to communicate with it or through API, but then it doesn't remember anything - smart, but stupid.

An agent, however, is capable of performing chains of many actions, maintaining flow, making decisions, analyzing, clarifying, interacting with other Agents and people, i.e. essentially creating an entire organizational structure of AI agents and working 100% autonomously in conditions of uncertainty, receiving unstructured data.

That is, an Assistant cannot REPLACE a marketer or accountant, for example, but can only HELP them with performing certain tasks.

But an Agent **can 100% replace an entire department** of marketing or a huge accounting department, when instead of a friendly women's collective of 50 people there remain 2 people - the chief accountant who thoroughly understands the subject and a developer (not a programmer) of an AI agent, someone who can build the work cycle (process) of the entire department, connect it with all services and connect AI at different stages, and not one, but several.

Imagine that you need an executor who will perform NOT ONE action (like an answer to a question during a dialogue), but **MANY actions, and WITHOUT YOUR participation.** You give them a list of tasks, activities, some of your comments, and that's it - go ahead, do it! Like a super household helper, but they'll also file taxes for you, or negotiate with clients, answer letters - INTELLIGENTLY. And this helper is AI, but!!!

You don't want to constantly have endless conversations with AI so it does routine actions instead of you, because explaining to it each time or even using something like GPTs is annoying. No - you don't want that. You want it differently.

You have a long instruction of a mass of points, and YOU WANT the AI agent to do ALL these actions WITHOUT your participation, and to delve into things, act flexibly, adapt to the situation, and not bother you.

That is, you need a SMART executor to whom you'll outline the goal (criteria for achieving it), and they'll do everything themselves, get it, figure it out, and only bother you if they encounter a situation where they don't have instructions.

Like "should I pay this dude or send them packing? And in what cases to pay, and when not?" Or like "Should I zero out taxes in the accounting report or throw the tax authorities 5 cents?", etc.

And chatGPT can't do such tasks, and simple dialogue through API also can't. But an AI agent can.
