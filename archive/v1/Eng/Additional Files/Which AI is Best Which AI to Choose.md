**Which AI is Best? Which AI to Choose? From OpenAI, from Google, from Anthropic, DeepSeek? Which image generator to use? Midjourney or Stable Diffusion?**

Which AI is best? Which AI to choose? From OpenAI, from Google, from Anthropic, DeepSeek? Which image generator to use? Midjourney or Stable Diffusion? Which is better for making videos? SORA or Kling, or maybe Pica, or maybe Runway? Or Haygen?

What to choose from hundreds of startups, endless assistants, smart chats? Or maybe Elon Musk's Groc3 killed everyone? Or Chinese models? Or Yandex's chat?

Which is best for writing texts? Which is best for coding? Which is best for solving mathematical problems?

If I see that, as one hick wrote here "Groc3" beat everyone, or some programmer writes "Sonnet is the coolest," then I understand that this is written by an ignorant dilettante. Let's figure it out.

**At the moment there are more than 1,445,971 open models.**

1. Yep. That's in a couple of years. Didn't know, huh? Not counting closed ones from OpenAI, Groc3, Anthropic, Google, etc. see https://huggingface.co/models

2. Models are very different. There are language models that work with any text (code is a variety of text), reasoning models, generators of the same texts, images, videos, sounds, models for computer vision, models for natural language processing, for audio processing, models for fast processing of real-time processes, IoT, etc. There are multi-modal models and mono-modal models.

As a result, models show different quality on different tasks, like any tool, models have their application boundaries and cases where you can achieve the best results. But that's not all.

3. There are many platforms where model competitions are held, offering them test tasks from different sections of science, working with texts, with code, with mathematics, etc. One of the most famous platforms is https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard

On it you can choose different types of tasks, and you'll see that DIFFERENT models lead on different tasks.

For example, in writing code at the current moment the leaders are:

1. chocolate (Early Grok-3)
2. o3-mini-high from (Open AI)
3. Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-02-05 (Google).

**In working with texts, in "creative writing" the leaders are:**

1. ChatGPT-4o-latest (2025-01-29) — (Open AI)
2. chocolate (Early Grok-3)
3. Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-Exp-01-21 (Google)

**In working with Russian language:**

1. Gemini-2.0-Pro-Exp-02-05 (Google)
2. Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-Exp-01-21 (Google)
3. chocolate (Early Grok-3)

Caveat: ChatGPT-4o-latest (2025-01-29) — is 4th, and o1-2024-12-17 is 5th place.

**Can this be trusted? No, and here's why.**

Guess in 3 tries, who creates all these tests and evaluates the models? Correct!

Programmers and geeks. And these guys understand perfectly well about technologies and code, but don't understand shit about texts. Because all the texts they work with are manuals and papers, which from a literary point of view represent dreary crap.

I.e., programmers consider these normal tests. Because they haven't read anything sweeter than a carrot. Some Borges, or at worst Cervantes or even Umberto Eco. Or Marquez, finally. Okay, I understand I'm asking a lot. Ok!

Monday Begins on Saturday? No? The Seagull? Which is Jonathan Livingston? Sorry, I'm trolling. Attack on Titan and a game of Tanks is our limit.

**Proof:** If it were otherwise, professions such as technical writer, copywriter, UX writer would not exist.

On average, the worst blogger writes more creative texts than the coolest programmer.

I, for example, very much respect Andrej Karpathy (cool guy in AI community), but if you look at his SUPER famous lectures on AI from the point of view of Instructional Design — it's a disaster. In Russian: He doesn't know how to explain CLEARLY.

**Intermediate conclusion:**

— Not only do different models lead in different tests, but trust in these tests is sometimes questionable.
— Keep in mind that there are also many of these competition platforms, they all compete for traffic and shout — "At mine, at mine everything is the only right way."

But everything is much, much worse.

**The problem, as smart IT guys formulate it: garbage in, garbage out.**

3. Translating for humanities people:

— If you ask the model stupidity, you'll get stupidity.
— If you don't know how to correctly formulate prompts, you'll get stupidity.
— If you don't understand for which case this model is better suited, you'll get crap.

Starting to get it? Let's continue with analogies:

— Don't blame the mirror if your face is crooked!
— You shouldn't crack nuts with a microscope (this is exactly what 99% of those who communicate with modern models do).

And the cherry on top, a quote from Bill (our everything) Gates: A smart person can be taught, a fool cannot be made smart!

**Bottom line. First the good news — if you're smart, educated and CAPABLE of learning, AI will amplify you. If you're a dumbass and a hick, AI won't help you.**

HARD CORE: And if you don't understand humor and banter, then only death and 234 rebirths will help you, starting with a dung fly. It's like training a model — you need a lot of data, compute (calculations) and money to teach a model not just to understand you, but also to recognize humor. So — nothing personal. Moving on and here AGAIN a problem.

"So which AI to choose, motherfucker? I hate all these word walls. You, asshole, tell me simply! And justify it!"

Ok. How many of you code? I think 2%, and in 5 years it will be 0%, so don't worry about coding, AI will code for you anyway and below I'll say which is better.

But you all need texts, some need tables, everyone needs search, answers to questions. I.e., look at what you do MOST? Answer:

You mostly read, try to understand, write some texts, create documents, analyze data, sometimes interact with services, less often make pictures, sometimes designs, quite rarely video and even more rarely sound and music. And you all communicate, answer questions.

Therefore, of course, there are models that solve advanced mathematical problems, but they are needed by 5% of you — scientists, programmers, engineers.

**But 100% of you need models to which you can...**

ask questions, analyze documents, images, sometimes solve some problems, consult and do all this in Russian or English (and any language), but you want the model to understand Russian well and write well in it.

And coding later. Do you understand my simple thought? And at the moment the answer to the question "Which AI to choose?" — you can find in the pictures, and I explain why it's so, but first a caveat:

[CAVEAT]

**You can all look and compare here yourself:**

**Why for 99% of you is the model from OpenAI, i.e. chatGPT and others — THE BEST choice?**

6 arguments why you shouldn't rack your brain which model to choose for 90% of tasks?

1. Because at the moment chatGPT is the leader in 90% of the most important tasks.
2. Because chatGPT provides not only a model but also the most convenient functional interface, and this is critically important when your task is more complex than a soup recipe.
3. Because chatGPT is sharpened for normal people, not developers.
4. ONLY chatGPT is capable of communicating EXCELLENTLY by VOICE in Russian at the moment, moreover, both in the desktop application and in the mobile application. I.e., you can normally humanly talk only with chatGPT!
5. OpenAI currently has the most developed infrastructure for creating AI Agents based on their AI Assistant chatGPT, comparable only with Google's Vertex AI Agent Builder (but we haven't gotten to that yet).
6. Regarding code creation. To create code, you need a development environment. At the moment the most popular and free is VS code, which easily integrates with chatGPT, or you can use Cursor, which is a fork of VS code, and allows integration with several models.

I.e., this is an important point — WITH WHICH MODELS do popular services integrate like: https://vercel.com/ / https://replit.com/

Why is this important? Because if you choose some hyped free model for PRACTICAL tasks, then SUDDENLY you realize that **it has no bells and whistles and infrastructure**. It's like instead of a car you get a pile of spare parts and units. Well yes, nerds love this. But people need to DO BUSINESS, not all sorts of hemorrhoids.

**A very indicative example for the market**

However, since you, of course, don't believe me (I'm a cunning info-gypsy, it's you who are all smart and don't understand that my background is 10 times bigger than yours), here's a comparative study, performed through Perplexity and Groc3:

2. Groc3: https://x.com/i/grok/share/rBK5Pl3l6TC3Jd1oBJWTls36e

Conclusion. To start studying AI, to start using AI, to understand what and how it works in 90% of tasks 100 out of 100 is better with chatGPT. How to do this?

Watch the program of the short and FREE course "How to use ChatGPT effectively?". In the course I systematized my practices, so it's more like a master class. It turned out to be about 10 hours. I show capabilities and added small tests.
