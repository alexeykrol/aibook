**Why is it so important to understand ChatGPT first?**

Because if you master its capabilities, you can make it a full-fledged partner that solves a huge number of tasks. I'm sure most of you use 5-10% of ChatGPT's capabilities. And when you understand all its functions and how to work with them, you'll reach another level.

Understand, the idea is for you to use ChatGPT as a teacher and partner without a human. An AI Assistant can explain many things, it always has time, it always strives to help, it gives a quality answer to almost any question. But there's a nuance. **What is this nuance?** Remember, if you want to get a good answer, you must ask the right question.

When it comes to learning, it's important not only to receive information but also to understand what questions are worth asking. Yes, chatGPT can answer almost any question. But if you don't understand the subject, then you don't know what question to ask and in what sequence.

Starting to get it? Imagine you're in a huge room. You have a key, and you need to find the keyhole to get out of the dungeon. The key is already in your hands, but the keyhole is not visible. You can search for it for a very long time. And if it's not just a room but an entire castle?

Everything related to artificial intelligence is more like a castle. You walk with a key around this castle, ask questions, but don't move forward. Because you don't know where the keyhole is. You don't know what question to ask.

**And if there's someone who says**: "Here's the keyhole," you open the door — and go into a new world. This, actually, is the value of the book. Practically all the material I use can be found on the internet. A huge, monstrous number of links — all this is free, available, can be watched. **But there's a problem**: all this is scattered in different places. Many articles, services, tools require not just studying but understanding and practice.

You can figure it out yourself, of course. But 99% of people simply won't have enough time, willpower, and persistence. It's not simple. Such is reality.

I try to solve this problem. I collect everything in one place, compactly. I've already spent this time. Plus, I always explain clearly, because I look at the situation not as a techie, but as a person who cares about getting results, benefits. If it's about business — I approach from this side. I don't delve into technologies more than necessary. I do it so that you don't just read but start to understand what it is and how to apply it.

If you don't know anything and don't understand about AI**, after the book you'll be reborn from the opening possibilities.**
