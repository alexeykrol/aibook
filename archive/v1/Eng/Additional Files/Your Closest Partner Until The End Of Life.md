Your Closest Partner Until the End of Life.

At the course there were quite a few people of age, over 65, over 60, over 70, 75. There, I think, was one participant who is 88 years old. This is very pleasant, because I see that artificial intelligence revives people, revives their mind, because it gives them some opportunities they never even dreamed of. People at this age start to dream again, ambition arises in them again, they suddenly understand that they can do some things they couldn't do before. And what they can create is in no way connected to their age.

Moreover, their life wisdom, their understanding just gives them significantly greater advantage when they communicate with artificial intelligence, because the quality of the result you get from communicating with AI directly depends on you. A young inexperienced person, in principle, is not capable of asking normal, correct questions, getting maximum effect. Because they are - too young.

For a mature person, artificial intelligence will give orders of magnitude more. That unique and rare case in our time when experience gives you an advantage. I would like to wish all people of more advanced age not to be afraid to start, because a new universe will open before you, and you will strongly feel young again in some spiritual, intellectual sense. Because artificial intelligence will become a partner for you who will help. They won't argue with you — in the sense, somehow stupidly, as children often argue. You understand, right? When we communicate with children, we often just understand that they're acting like idiots, and we understand that they have no chance of understanding some things that you've already understood simply because they're still too young. Haven't lived enough, haven't eaten enough.

Children tend to underestimate their parents and overestimate themselves. On the other hand, artificial intelligence can act for you as that very partner who not only helps you realize something, but also listens to you, and together you create what, perhaps, you cannot create with your children. I think having such a partner will help a huge number of people overcome the painful connection with children. This problem exists — very strongly — primarily for mothers. For fathers — it happens when they're too attached to their children. Children are already adults, but parents try to interfere in their lives, conflicts arise, misunderstandings and so on.

However, when you have a partner in the form of artificial intelligence, whom you yourself raise and who will remain an adult, this allows you to LET GO of your children and start living calmly, freely. And believe me, the children's attitude towards you will change. Because suddenly the children will feel that you've stopped interfering in their lives. And inevitably the children will return to you. Because your children will run into those walls that you've already passed and passed long ago, children will face problems over which you now laugh.
