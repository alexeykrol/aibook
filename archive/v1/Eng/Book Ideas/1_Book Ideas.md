A couple of ideas for the future book.

1. **First — make it immediately in the form of a quest.** Well, that is, sort of almost in the LARP/RPG genre. Not overdoing it, but nevertheless. That is, each chapter is the next level, where you need to put in a little more effort. There are puzzles, there are monsters. That is, use this language. Monsters, naturally, are all our fears. Puzzles — everything related to artificial intelligence technologies. And, accordingly, the prize. That is, why we take such a step. Basically like such a game-instruction, which, by the way, can initially be implemented as a game. Especially since this is not stipulated in the contract — need to look carefully. Plus, I also have electronic versions on the right.

2. **Second point — many promises.** That is, we need to constantly sell: what opportunities you will get. Third — consider that it's very easy all the time. Regardless of age, gender, or any factors. The main thesis — that yes, you need to learn, but to start doing something, you need not 2-3 years, but 2 weeks. And an important point that often, looking back at the past 10 years, suddenly we realize that we spent all these 10 years on some absolutely useless things, while we could have spent 3-4 months mastering a skill that would have lifted us to the top.

And at present, we can say for sure that if the last 25-30 years — this was a skill related to programming, plus marketing, plus traffic, all this — blimp, marketing, programming, entrepreneurship — now we can say that everything related to artificial intelligence technologies is added to this, except that the barrier to entry has been lowered. This can be compared to the appearance of Photoshop and so on. If we take analogies, 20 years ago Photoshop cost wild money, and only a few people owned it, now practically any person in 5 minutes, using an abundance of packages, can do whatever they want with a picture.

3. **Next, third — insert pieces of "old-timers' hysteria" related to roles, insert pieces of "quest"**, well, that is, such philosophical ones too. That is, on one hand, it's a guide, on the other hand — it's such wisdom.

4. **Fourth — we cover everything possible, not just for beginners**, because we can clearly divide several large opportunities that I described. That is, the simplest — is using ChatGPT 5, just mastering prompts. Then we have projects, DeepResearch, all that. Then we master everything related to projects with JSONs. Then we have using API, why and so on. And slowly we approach agents. That is, some pieces from the course — philosophical, algorithmic — what we add there, but all this in an absolutely simplest manner. And all the time we remind that it's all very simple, it's all common sense. Constantly use the method of analogies and living language. Don't limit. Up to code and front-end. Emphasis on removing fears.

5. **Perhaps it makes sense to build the book in the form of a dialogue, where a group, each member of the group** is like an archetype of the reader, and they also have some mentors, of course. That is, the group is a young person, a middle-aged person, an elderly person, girls and so on. That is, possibly weave in a story there, so there is a story, so there is a plot, so there is intrigue. And the essence of the quest is that in order to pass the next stage of the quest, to learn the intrigue, you need to master some tool. That is, this is the idea. Rather insert cases where there are typical questions and answers of the Sage, with whom you can talk. Naturally, a big emphasis on various cases in everyday life, in health, in creativity, in business, in marketing, in science. Well, that is, the main such things.

**6. Pictures in the book, and pictures on the website.** Well, and naturally, on the website — this is illustration. We will have two types of illustrations. These are screenshots, of course, where we indicate what is where. But at the same time, all the time the thesis: if you haven't mastered the interface, you use the child's method. So, the child's method — click on all the buttons, see what happens. If you're afraid that something terrible will come, then you always remember that nothing terrible will happen. Well, if you're really afraid, then remember that you will all die sooner or later anyway. Because we came here to play.

**7. Of course, the book should have a large electronic appendix on the website**, where you can go and download all blueprints, all schemes, all guides, all descriptions. That is, we actually get that the book itself is a kind of portal that then leads somewhere further. And the idea here is that if you want to use this book more effectively, it's better to take the electronic version. The electronic version is much more interesting because it has more profit — I have 50% there. Plus the idea is that if I give a large number of links in advance to my resource, where I make a separate resource dedicated to this book (and I make resources in Russian, in English), you can do anything there. Naturally, right there on the website I can already do anything. I can make all kinds of partnerships there, which formally don't contradict the contract with Eksmo, but give me the opportunity to fully control the situation. Plus, naturally, in electronic versions I can make lots and lots of upsells. That is, in this way it turns out that if the book is sold, it becomes its own frontend.

**8. Plus, naturally, we need to come up with some social mechanics**, some virtual partnership that makes people not just buy this book, but register, because it gives some gifts. Right away say that register from Tanta, because you will receive this as a gift. Here. And immediately insert all kinds of game mechanics, all kinds of free courses. And, speaking, a lot of material can be pulled outside the book in the form of micro-courses. Because actually the book becomes for us, so to speak, a traffic generator with strong, strong social mechanics.

**9. Insert many harsh quotes**... very short ones.

10. Plus — and this is also needed — we must definitely create several very valuable, most custom chat-GPTs, here, free ones, which are entries into the general system. Create a custom one for each chapter, which answers.... That is, roughly speaking, we have an answer to the question, and a person is given some links, some references. This will also be a separate layer of such custom GPT chats. The second layer — this is when we have a layer with backend, with frontend.

**10. We must definitely create the main mentor** for this book, who will be for each lesson. That is, yes, we upload the base there, and it tells us all this for each lesson, synchronizes with the route and so on. At the same time, this custom... It's on the principle: also the first doses are free, and then little by little — paid. That is, our book is a portal through which we sell everything-everything-everything: and community, meaning club, community, mentoring of other people. You can immediately say that if you want to be a mentor to promote, for this you must complete a course, pass an exam — that's it, and you're there. First GPT — test system — and get a certificate. After you get the certificate, you describe yourself, and we start integrating you into the general system.

In the book we have several heroes and the first type of mentors. And as one of the significant options — is the opportunity to communicate with these mentors, ask them questions. Well, naturally, this is the Butcher, the Wanderer, and, actually, the Mentor. The Mentor — he... well, it's clear, their roles. And it's important to make them so that people can gradually subscribe to them and so they become their, so to speak, best in some sense.

**11. Book addition. Need to give each chapter a task.** And it should be done so that the task is partially in the book, and partially — so they go to the website. And you can add tests at the end of each chapter on the website too, so they constantly go to the website and take tests. That is, make it as interactive as possible. And so people prefer the electronic book more.

Even better — not like that. So they buy the book, and then want to buy the electronic book. Because the electronic book gives much more opportunities. You can follow links, go to the website. And there on the website — a whole abyss. Well, and upsells, naturally.

**Promotion**:

**Interviews with a bunch of people, both Western and Russian-speaking.** And these interviews can be recorded, immediately uploaded to YouTube. And, accordingly, partially insert these interviews into the book, make some important quotes — from all kinds of super-mega-successful people and so on. Well, that is, sketch out this concept of a global project.

It turns out to have several layers. That is, one layer is, actually, textual, well in the sense of books. And the second layer is electronic. Yes, definitely immediately emphasize in many places. This should be done with zoo-registration — each time for a gift. That is, if you register in this newsletter, plus there's a Telegram channel, well, that is, little by little promote all these moments in order to build a base.

At the same time, if a person... That is, we proceed from the fact that, naturally, the electronic version will be pirated. Accordingly, for us it doesn't matter — whether a person got this book for free or bought it somewhere. For us it's important that they come to the website and start receiving a subscription and so on, because anyway we'll upsell them somewhere on something serious.

Plus, I think, by that time there will already be a course on agents created with a bunch of additions, which, actually, we will buy traffic for. Here, approximately like that. Plus, well, actually, that's enough for now, since we need to formalize this, transform it into some plan, make synchronization.

Of course, we'll need to use some texts from the courses I'm making now. Naturally, in the course of the play. That is, there first without any code at level four-five, then we have API, then we have Make. In itself — all these moments. Then we'll get to code, to server and so on, and so on. Here. There's always a reminder: if you've hit some dead end, see there, then there — you ask there, there, there.

Here. Most likely, we need, of course, right away... Well yes, we need, we need, of course, to take the theory of roles, finish us the calling market. And again, we shouldn't ask for much — by the same way. That is, find a publisher that will publish this in principle, and think about how to start promoting electronically. In general, we need to move in this direction too.

**Social Mechanics.**

- Where I will add them... Yes, what else is definitely needed — is to ask people for their cases, examples of successful implementations. Such wow-cherry-peaks, yes. That is, when you have someone like: "I implemented this, this, this". Right there a link. That is, this book should give a lot of traffic to different people.

- Plus we need an appeal: if you want to get traffic — describe your case and send it to us. Plus you should also... Well, that is, we need to come up with referrals, partnerships — all this also needs to be done. You can also talk about the topic with Aerok — maybe it will be interesting. He understands these referrals, partnerships — this can all be done somehow too.

Yes, and it's important that the whole book is saturated with gifts:

- prompts first, prompts for research, examples, JSONs from Make, JSONs from Rechand — with detailed comments.

- That is, in fact, in some sense the book is, let's say, a reincarnation of both courses. Just there everything is more, possibly, systematic. Well and, accordingly, references to the courses themselves, of course.

Plus — very powerful social mechanics. This is very, very important.

Strange:

- **Then all the time we weave in a little bit, slowly the game metaphor. Finally, the final chapter, actually, it will be devoted a little bit to the game metaphor, but not in the context...** Well, there are some basic things, naturally, remain. We refer them to other chapters. But the general idea is that artificial intelligence gives us the opportunity to check this statement by building a simple experiment. That is, we, actually, like packs of artificial telepaths — they, actually, do tests.

The essence of the test is that we build an internal system on our computer or in the cloud, and we understand that if our theory is correct, and we find some hacks with the help of artificial intelligence, then the physical environment of the computer will somehow respond to this. That is, here we move from direct control of the computer, which is within the framework of our usual deterministic physical picture of the world, we are precisely looking for anomalies. That is, there is some code that, if it runs, we understand how to measure the parameters of our small universe inside our computer. And then we start doing different experiments, we start looking at anomalies. That is, we are interested not when the situation develops as predicted, but when events occur that are not predicted.

That is, the approach itself is like hackers. That is, we are looking for holes. Holes are suspected when our system reacts not as it should. That is, roughly speaking, when our system interacts with the user, it's actually a set of some corridors, and the system always directs the user into the total corridor, because this is how the level of access rights is maintained. That is, the system doesn't let the user enter the wrong corridor, so that, God forbid, the user doesn't get a higher level of access and opportunities. But, nevertheless, if you look at these corridors, there are always some holes that the system or developers didn't account for. And the task of hackers is to look for these holes. If these holes are found, then it's like a door in the wall that was not visible — the same metaphorical passage through the wall. And in this case, we not only leave the corridor — we leave the entire system of corridors altogether. And we find ourselves at a higher level, where we are not limited by the rights imposed on us.

This is the final chapter, in which we, in principle, hint that our Universe is not our Universe, we are not us and so on. And also this is all possibly in the form of dialogue between our group. And, actually, this group itself initially gets into some difficult situation. And in order to get out of this situation, it tries to learn the tools.
