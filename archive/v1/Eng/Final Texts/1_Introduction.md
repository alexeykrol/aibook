Preface.

*"The fastest way to get a job is to learn AI"*

*(c) Naval Ravikant.*

In March 2025 I had 40 thousand subscribers on FB, now over 120 thousand and each day 1-2 thousand more are added. How did this happen? I just shared an observation that in a couple of years some people will have smart AI, and others will have stupid AI. Questions poured in: "What to do to have smart AI, not stupid?" The answer wasn't so simple, and I made a short free course where I told about how I communicate with AI and grow it into a genius digital child. Taking money for this seemed shameful to me.

As a result, in a month more than 15 thousand people took the course and people left more than 1000 reviews. Many times they asked to write a book. I accepted the idea with interest, and thought it was worth explaining the technology to people, making something like a manual.

How wrong I was! Everything was not that. I wasn't grasping something, and then I started reading reviews. I read all 1000+ reviews, and my eyes opened. I saw what most triggered people, I saw that very "Aha moment!" that literally blew minds. It turned out that people absolutely don't need manuals and knowledge. All that people really need is hope, a motivational kick that will open the gates. And then people are capable of learning anything themselves. This is especially strongly indicated by the fact that artificial intelligence is the best Teacher on the planet.

I thought long about what to include in the book and what not. There's always a temptation to give as much as possible. But here too reviews helped: it turned out that only a few key moments give that very "Aha effect". Why? Because if learning goes long and understanding arises slowly - no consciousness explosion happens. But when they show you some completely tiny detail, and you unexpectedly see how many opportunities are right under your nose, how you underestimated them - doubts disappear instantly.

This is a specific trigger. It turns you from a doubting skeptic into a burning adept. Not because someone convinced you of something, but because you yourself saw, tried in five seconds - and an abyss opened before you. You went cold, broke into sweat, tears came to your eyes - at this moment a miracle happens. All the ideas that came to your mind for years but weren't realized for a million reasons - because there was no knowledge, time, helpers, team, money, - all these ideas suddenly wake up. And they tell you: "Now you can". And you understand: yes, I can.

You suddenly become a magician quickly and easily. Only because you mastered a few basic things. I don't tell how AI works. I only show how I use AI myself, what I, and therefore you, can do. And people have - mind explosion! I show and tell those very "non-secret" secrets that we never see, because they lie right under our nose. Because we seek useless complexity. It turned out that you don't need to shove a lot into a book. A few basic approaches are enough, and they change consciousness, people start learning themselves - greedily, fanatically, everywhere they can. After all, the entire paradigm of modern education still consisted of finding an expert, enrolling in courses, paying money… And you believe in this, but as soon as you've mastered the basics, it releases you. Now you understand that you no longer need universities, or courses, nothing at all. You already know everything. You can get an answer to any question. If not immediately - ask again.

Artificial intelligence is that very friend, mentor, teacher with whom you can do anything. It will be with you until the end of life. It won't betray you. Nothing more powerful has existed in human history. And all you need is to reach out your hand, read the book you're holding, take a couple of steps. Literally today, now. Everything is described step by step. Start reading the first couple-three chapters, start doing. It'll take 15 minutes - and your mind will explode. Your pressure will rise, your heartbeat will quicken, you'll want to sit or lie down. I'm saying this precisely, because it happened to me many times. And to a huge number of people - too. What's happening now is a revolution. But this revolution will be merciful to those who started moving. You don't need to be a religious fanatic and naive. I always tell people: don't believe - just check. It will take a few minutes.

However, the book goes further, because in a certain sense artificial intelligence doesn't differ from humans. Want to get a clear answer from AI? Learn to ask the right questions. This is a fundamental skill, and it's precisely when working with AI that you sharpen it so strongly that gradually you learn to ask truly important questions. And to whom do you ask them? Your AI? No. You'll start asking questions to yourself, especially questions you're afraid of. And then you start getting answers that open doors that were previously tightly closed. "We are rich in answers, but poor in questions". Or, as Heidegger says: "The question is the piety of thinking".

AI is not another new fashionable technology, but new good news "Now you can!" Now you can dream again, want, create, do, achieve. Now you're young again, now all paths are open to you again. Career, business, creativity, technology, science. Now you can do what you didn't dare think about. Now you can learn - anything you wish. And, even now you can everything, even if you're alone.

## For Whom This Book Is and Disclaimers

Yes, certainly, artificial intelligence is obviously the strongest, most powerful innovation, and much more powerful than the invention of the wheel, sewerage, even the internet itself and computer, and I have two news for you: good and bad.

The good news is that yes, indeed AI radically expands our capabilities. And most importantly - to realize these capabilities, no education is needed, nothing is needed. There are no specific conditions or obstacles that would prevent you from gaining these capabilities. Artificial intelligence is 100% democratically accessible to everyone, it's the new "great equalizer".

The bad news is that the only ones who can realize AI's capabilities are people who have at least minimal ambitions, desire to grow, develop and learn. This is the only condition, which is also necessary and sufficient. The reverse is also true: even if you have excellent education, you're not stupid, but there's no internal ambition, there will be no use from artificial intelligence for you.

What's the conclusion from this? Obviously, artificial intelligence will sooner or later be implemented in almost all aspects of our life: from everyday to everything related to career, business, study, health. However, in this book we will NOT consider artificial intelligence from the point of view of how AI will change our life, because there's already a huge amount of speculation on this topic, and you can read fiction.

In this book we will consider artificial intelligence exclusively from one point of view:

* What specific capabilities you get, that is what you can now do and…
* How to really gain these capabilities.

Therefore - the first and only condition for gaining capabilities - you must have ambitions. How old you are, what your profession is, what your education is, what you can or can't do, what your religion is, what your health condition is, even if you're a 99-year-old elder living in the taiga, - this doesn't matter at all. Nothing is an obstacle for you to radically change your life with AI. Except fear and laziness, of course, but here the book will definitely help you. You'll meet some secret weapon there.

Accordingly, if for some reason you have no ambitions, no desire to grow due to age or character, then, unfortunately, you won't be able to gain access to new capabilities. That's such a paradox.

The reason for this bitter cataclysm is that artificial intelligence at the moment is the most powerful tool that humanity has invented. And therefore, like any tool, it must be mastered, learned to understand how to use it maximally, how exactly to gain access to God's capabilities. And like any learning, you must have a reason, motivation to make efforts, spend time. After all, you know - as a rule, success is achieved not by the smartest and most educated, but by the most motivated and persistent.

In general, you don't even need to make any special efforts, simply in fact we're talking NOT about artificial intelligence, about how to realize its capabilities, and you need to make effort to master them. And for this you need ambitions, minimal will, ability not to quit, which itself is very difficult. That's where the dog is buried.

Learning, growing is not about reading textbooks. It's about the ability not to quit, the ability to ask questions - sometimes simple, even stupid. The ability not to be afraid to look naive in other people's eyes. In a certain sense - the ability to remain a child, regardless of age. If you have all this, artificial intelligence opens a portal to another dimension for you. For those who became too "adult" and "experienced", my personal opinion - artificial intelligence will give nothing, but rather will take away. At minimum, a stable job in the near future.

Pragmatic conclusion: the book is intended exclusively for people who have at least small ambitions, ideas, desires to create or change something in their life. For those who have, in a good sense, "a thorn in the ass". These can be even the simplest things like wanting to earn money. Why not? Here the question is not in the quality of ambitions, but simply in their presence in principle.

Practice shows, if you have ambitions and desire to grow, then even if the ambitions are primitive, as you develop the level of your ambitions will grow. Maybe at first you just want to earn money and buy a better car, but who knows? Perhaps in some time you'll want, like Elon Musk, to create spaceships, traverse the expanses of the Universe, search for cures for cancer or improve people's lives on the planet. The main thing is that you always have this thirst for growth, curiosity, desire to create. If you have it, the book will become a portal for you.

Actually the book resembles a Quest. You enter a labyrinth, must find the right path, encounter puzzles, sometimes hit dead ends, but each time you reach a door behind which is the next level. At a new level you have even more capabilities, but to get them, you need to pass another labyrinth. And as in any quest, there are prizes and rewards. The capabilities that artificial intelligence gives are prizes, but for them you need to try a little bit.

What's the main AI difference from everything that was before its creation? Look, before the AI era, if you take your time spent on learning and compare it with the benefits you get, then one day of study gave almost nothing. You had to study for years and practice for as long to start meaning something. At least create something. What changed with the arrival of AI?

Artificial intelligence gives a radically new level. Now, if you spend at least one day learning together with AI, you immediately get the opportunity to really create something. Learning speed and ability to create increase thousands of times. What previously required years, now requires days.

And finally the most inspiring - now, with AI's help you can create what you fundamentally couldn't before at all, because there wasn't enough time to learn, not enough resources, money, people. Now to learn you need hours and days, not years. You'll go a thousand times faster. You spend a day, maybe minutes or hours - and immediately get a result you couldn't even think about before.

In this book each chapter is a new level of your personal quest. I'll talk about new capabilities and small, quite simple steps that don't require anything special to get a result. Steps are simple, efforts are minimal, no special conditions or education needed, result - immediate. It doesn't matter if you're a programmer or not, techie or humanist. The main thing is desire, common sense and readiness to allocate a little time. Each chapter is a new level of capabilities and steps that need to be taken to advance. After all, as in any game, you can't get a prize by doing nothing. The same in life: the bigger the prize, the more efforts and deeper the path. Good news - you yourself determine how far you want to go and how quickly. Someone will only slightly "dig", and their life will already change. And someone will want to go deeper - and will move to another reality.

A skeptical reader will immediately be wary: "Sounds tempting? And how exactly to get such luxury in your hands? How to break through the glass ceiling? You can promise anything. Sounds too incredible. How to try yourself, even small, and immediately get a result, and so it's right "Wow!"?

I love skeptical readers, because they're inclined not to blindly believe, but to think with their head, so I always recommend: "Don't believe me. Believing, not believing - that's for priests, and I'm not a priest. Check with your practice. Believe your experience. Believe the results you achieve independently. I'm only showing the path with an important caveat - this is not some general path, but how I go myself. With all the rare insights, even rarer successes and frequent failures. You can of course ask me - "Do I know a more effective path?" Sorry, but I don't. If you need guarantees, then apparently you should turn to happiness marathons.

## So, Let's Figure It Out. The Main Thing Is the Quest.

That's exactly how I wrote the book. Each chapter is a Quest level that you have to pass, and immediately the main question - why? What will I get from this?

Excellent question and passing the Quest level promises prizes. In our case, prizes are new capabilities that you get by passing the level. Capabilities to do what you fundamentally couldn't do or do something 1000 times faster and better. Essentially this is a Quest about how to become a magician. The further you go, the more super skills, abilities you get. The more worlds and spaces become accessible to you. With each new level a world opens up for you that you had no chance at all to touch, even see with one eye.

And, as in any quest, to get prizes, you need to pass labyrinths, solve puzzles, pump up skills, grind a bit of useful resources, defeat bosses. Bad news - you can't get to the next level without passing the previous one, without solving all puzzles, without collecting magical artifacts and defeating the boss. That is, you can read, but you can't get inside, master super abilities. Why? Because magic is practice, not theory. Consider that AI is a Genie who can give you everything, but first you need to tame it and speak the same language with it. But don't worry, as in any Quest we'll start from the very initial, simple level. Nevertheless, even passing only level 1 - you'll not just have your Genie, but it will do for you what 99% of the planet's population can't do. Yes, this is not a joke. Passing only level 1 moves you into the select 1% of the population who can talk to the AI Genie in its magical language, and a bit later you'll understand - how important it is to be able to pronounce the right spells (prompts), how powerful capabilities this opens.

## Quest Logic:

• **Level = new AI work skill** (Prompting, Research, projects, custom GPT, automations, special services, data analysis, development and agents).

• **Reward = new capabilities and tasks** that you can now solve in different spheres (learning, career, business, health, creativity, etc.).

• **Labyrinths = specific tasks** that need to be passed to consolidate the level.

• **Diamonds = experience and new tools** that accumulate after passing.

• Without the skill of the previous level - you can't go further. As in a game: until you learn to prompt - Deep Research won't open; until you master projects - you can't build custom GPTs; until you understand automations - you won't create agents. That is, the book is structured as a **game journey**:

• Entrance: "You start as a beginner, you have only one tool - the ability to babble something in conversation with AI".

• Each level: "To go further, you need to master a new skill. Pass the tests, and new capabilities will open to you".

• End: "At the top - you manage entire systems and agents. Previously this was the lot of corporations, now it's accessible to you".

Now briefly - what awaits you?

## Level 1. The Art of Communication - The Genie's Gates (AI)

You stand at the very first gates. Inside you is a thirst to learn, create, change life. You're full of enthusiasm and anticipation, **but there's a problem**:

You don't know how to talk to the Genie. You ask - it answers nonsense, is stupid. You request - it doesn't understand. You think that "you just need to ask a question", and here your first enemy awaits you - your own vagueness, habit of thinking in half-words and being lazy to formulate clearly.

You don't know how to speak AI's language, don't know what to expect from it. You're disappointed.

At this level your mission is to master **the art of spells (the art of composing powerful prompts)**. You must learn to formulate prompts so that the Genie (AI) executes them precisely, and doesn't turn them into a crooked mirror. This seems a trifle, but it's exactly here that most fall. Who doesn't pass - will remain an ordinary user, complaining: "AI is stupid". But if you win, first **magical arts await you in your treasury**. What prizes await you if you pass the Level?

**Fast learning and gaining instant understanding:** What previously took years, now fits into weeks or days. This is your first chest of gold: knowledge without borders. You understand how to overcome AI hallucinations, how to avoid flattery from it. Suddenly and immediately AI turns into a serious and thoughtful teacher in any subjects. The quality of answers received from AI will change radically and enlightenment awaits you. Now you can learn at a comfortable pace, get explanations at your level, instantly check yourself and get feedback. What previously required a tutor or courses, became accessible to everyone.

**Understanding your health:** You can upload examination results, analyze doctors' conclusions, compare symptoms and find possible causes - all this was previously unavailable without medical education. AI will analyze your data in seconds, compare dozens of conclusions and build personalized nutrition and training plans. You have a whole clinic in your phone, available 24/7. This is not just process acceleration - this is a new level of control over your body. You no longer wait for an appointment, don't pay for each consultation. You have an expert who's always nearby. You save weeks of waiting and thousands of dollars. Now your health is in your hands like never before. This is your shield from fear and doubts.

**Managing well-being:** Previously you had to turn to a trainer or keep a diary manually. Now AI can build your personalized training plans, nutrition and track progress automatically.

**Job search:** You can analyze hundreds of vacancies 100 times faster, prepare a professional resume for each individual vacancy in seconds, create a portfolio and even train to pass interviews with AI's help.

**Creating texts.** Previously writing articles, books or dissertations was long labor. Writing letters, articles and reports took hours and days. Now you can create texts of professional quality in hours, and most importantly - write in genres where you have no experience.

**Translations and transcriptions.** Previously quality translation was the lot of professionals. Now anyone can get translations and transcriptions in real time.

**Analysis and creation of legal documents.** Previously analysis and drafting of contracts required a lawyer, required a lot of time. Now you can independently prepare a huge project of documents in minutes.

**Creating images:** Previously to draw a picture, you needed talent or years of practice. Most didn't even try. You can create cool pictures right now. Creativity becomes accessible to everyone who's ready to master the right prompt. This is your spark of inspiration that ignites a new "you".

**Creating music.** Previously composing music required knowledge and instruments. Now you can create songs, arrangements and even symphonies.

**Main Level Reward:** You've mastered the language of communication with the Genie (AI), now AI understands and listens to you. You've already got an advantage, now you're capable of getting 100 times more with AI's help than 99% of Earth's population.

You defeated the main boss, and no, this Boss is not AI at all, because all bosses that will have to be defeated in the Quest live not in AI, but in us. Having passed this level, you got the main revelation: **The quality of AI's answers depends only on the quality of questions, i.e. only on how you learned to create powerful prompts.**

But what rewards and trials await us at Level 2? What can we achieve by taking a few more steps in our Quest?

## Level 2. The Art of Research - The Labyrinth of Knowledge

You passed the first gates. Now AI listens to you and answers more clearly. But suddenly you notice that AI often lies in answers, and you need facts and links. Also AI gives only a piece, but you need a whole, voluminous puzzle. You want not just to hear, but **to understand in depth**, compare sources, find truth among noise. But that's not all. You need to research many sources, hundreds, you need reviews, comparisons and what to do with this? Sit for hours asking questions, then double-checking answers, then compiling?

Or you needed to understand how your competitors act, what strategies they use, what they emphasize. You spent hours, and sometimes days, viewing sites, reports, reviews and articles, but each time felt that you were missing something? You tried to build a marketing strategy, studied the market, target audience, looked at competitors' successful cases. But information was fragmented, data became outdated, and trends changed too quickly?

When you worked on a scientific review, you had to manually search for articles, check their relevance, figure out complex terms? Or maybe you were thinking of investing in several companies, but doubted? At the same time financial analytics seemed complex, you were afraid to miss important nuances.

You understand that when you have a complex, complicated task requiring many steps, fact checking, links, analysis, then the usual question-answer mode with AI doesn't fit. Something more is clearly needed.

Yes, this is so, and at this level your mission is to learn to set **multi-step tasks**. This is no longer just one question - one answer. This is a journey through the labyrinth of knowledge, where you need to be able to ask clarifications, build chains, collect facts into a system. The first enemy here is the illusion of simplicity. It seems that the Genie knows everything. But the truth is that it can make mistakes or answer too generally. And your strength is being able to dig deeper, check, compare. If you give up - you'll remain on the surface. If you pass - you'll get **new treasures** that open doors to science, business and career. At this level you'll master Deep Research mode, and new magical skills await you:

**Fact-checking:** Previously you had to spend hundreds of hours clarifying facts, links, references. Tedious, exhausting work. With AI on board you get all links, facts with explanations and comments. You can insert them into a dissertation immediately.

**Writing scientific articles, treatises, dissertations:** You need to prepare a structured document with problem statement, detailed analysis, reasoning, article reviews and links? How much time did you spend on this? Months? AI will do everything for you in 30-40 minutes of any volume.

**Analysis of tenders, proposals, article review, search for best offer:** Previously to make a review on a topic, you had to read dozens of articles and books for months, research vacancies, resumes, sites with offers, thousands of articles. This was possible only for researchers and students. For a review of hundreds of sources months were needed. Now with AI you can in 30 minutes(!) collect a systematic review: dozens of sources, key arguments, critical comparison. You see the whole picture, as if you have your own personal research group. This is your torch in the labyrinth of knowledge.

**Market analysis:** Previously to understand the market, you had to hire analysts, order reports, spend weeks and money. Now AI analyzes competitors in hours, forecasts trends and issues comparative tables. You get information that previously cost thousands of dollars. This is your chest with gold coins for strategies.

**Career, vacancy analysis:** Previously to figure out a new industry or profession, you spent months reading articles, wandered forums, asked acquaintances questions. Now AI helps understand the profession structure, key skills, prospects in 10 minutes. You immediately see the map of the terrain. This is your compass for career path.

**Document comparison:** You needed to compare dozens of documents, articles, contracts, get an extract, comparative analysis and report? Usually - several months. With AI - 20-30 minutes. Violinist - not needed!

**Main Level 2 Reward:** You mastered the art of collecting, analyzing and compiling unlimited volume of information 1000 times faster. Now the Genie for you is not only an interlocutor, but also an analyst, critic and advisor. You see depth, understand connections, can check and compare. The main thing - you save thousands of hours of precious time and tens of thousands of dollars. From now on you need no one to get outstanding analytical data, without turning to anyone.

**You defeated the next boss and got the next revelation:** The right prompt aimed at research + Deep Research mode gives such results that you break into sweat. And goosebumps from awareness of prospects. Your understanding - what's worth spending time on in analysis and research has completely changed.

You got out of the labyrinth a torch, compass, chest, amulet and shield. With these artifacts you're ready to go further - to Level 3.

## Level 3. The Art of Projects - The Tower of Creation

You passed the research labyrinth. Now you have the torch of knowledge, compass and shield. But it's time to understand: talks alone are not enough. Scattered answers don't add up to a system. You get a pile of gold, but it's scattered in bags. You need a chest, a workshop where you can put everything together.

At this level your mission is to master **the art of projects in AI**. Projects in ChatGPT are not just a chat. This is your **Tower of Creation**: a place where the Genie stores context, remembers what you've already done, and helps step by step build something big and holistic. At first glance it seems that this is just another "chat with folders". But the enemy here is chaos. You're drowning in notes, losing versions, forgetting what was done. Victory is in learning to work consistently, turning the flow of ideas into a result.

And if you pass this level, new treasures will open to you - the ability to create products that previously required teams and months of work. But the main thing - now you can work on large projects where several chats are thematically united and super power - uploading your documents that AI takes into account. You can upload an entire knowledge base to a project, and AI will rely on it. It's impossible to overestimate the benefits of working with projects. What prizes await you after passing the Labyrinth?

**Creating courses, textbooks, books:** Previously to create a course or textbook, write a book, you needed months of work, teams of methodologists, editors and designers, hundreds of pieces of text, links, illustrations. This was a long and expensive path. Now, together with AI in a ChatGPT project you can in days collect a full course: lesson plan, tests, assignments, texts. AI keeps everything in memory and helps bring to completion. You can write a book, essay, thesis project, collect scattered fragments in one place, and AI will remember all this. A project in AI is not a folder with chats and files, this is a New partner with your entire base of documents and project entities loaded into it.

**Business plan:** Previously to prepare a business plan or marketing strategy, you needed analysts, designers and months of work, assembly from numerous documents. Now in a ChatGPT project you step by step build a strategy: market research, sales plan, creatives for advertising. Everything is tied into one system. All these complex tasks are now done for you by AI.

**Science:** Previously to conduct research, you needed notebooks, tables, editors and teams. Now a ChatGPT project becomes your research laboratory: hypotheses, notes, reviews, structured conclusions - all in one place. This is your alchemical book: a laboratory without walls.

**Texts**: Previously to write a book or dissertation, you had to work with notes and drafts for years. Now a ChatGPT project stores chapters, edits, styles, helps maintain integrity and brings you to the finale. This is your magic book: text being born from chaos.

**Main Level 3 Reward:** Now you consolidate all dialogues and files in one place, giving the opportunity to become your project partner and remember all its contexts. Now you have not an abstract chat, but a project partner. As many projects, as many partners. You took the first step to creating your virtual team working together on voluminous projects including many pieces. This is impossible to overestimate. Everything is brought into a holistic system. AI keeps the entire context in memory, remembers your steps and helps move forward.

**You defeated a serious boss** - Chaos, inevitably arising in large projects. Now you can take on large projects - books, courses, research, business plans. Chaos is gone, and so is anxiety. Now everything is under control, and this gives confidence and calm.

You climbed the tower, and from here it's visible where to lead the Genie further. The gates of Level 4 are already waiting for you.

## Level 4. Custom GPTs - The Workshop of Executors

You learned to combine all efforts into projects, but a new enemy appears on the path, a new Boss - routine. It steals your days: the same explanations, monotonous letters, repetitive tasks. The Genie helps, but after a couple-three dialogues gets confused, and you have to start all over again.

**Your mission at this level** is to learn to focus AI for performing a specific routine, frequently repeated task. For this you create **Custom GPTs**: executors to whom you once give instructions, load necessary materials - and then they stably do work for you. At first glance it seems that this is just "another chat". But when you master this level, your life really starts to change, and you discover new magical superpowers:

**Own expert in anything:** Previously to figure out an article, materials, textbook or course, you spent hours on independent searches or waited for explanations from a teacher. **Now:** You have your own expert in this topic, a textbook or program is loaded into it, and it answers only on this topic, quickly and to the point. It takes into account exactly the focus you set, not publicly available data. But that's not all. Now this expert can answer on the topic not only to you, but to everyone with whom you share a link. You have your own "teacher in a box" - instant answers on any topic and no time loss. As many topics, as many teachers, experts you can create. All your colleagues, students, partners, clients can now ask questions to the teacher, consultant based on AI that you created.

**Creating unique resume per vacancy:** Previously to adjust a resume to each vacancy, you manually edited the document, struggled with wordings and lost hours. Even if you used AI, you had to compose a new prompt each time. **Now there's no such problem custom** GPT with your resume and vacancy templates does this in a second. You send dozens of precise resumes where you previously managed to prepare one. Also all your friends and colleagues can use the service you made. By the way, you can earn on it, since custom GTPs are accessible not only to you. You can give access to whoever you want. Now you have an advantage in speed and coverage - you're like playing with cheat codes.

**Business and work, working with texts, analysis:** Previously routine responses to clients, commercial proposals, standard reports, letters, standard document analysis, FAQ, product descriptions took half a day from you or the team. If you used AI, then again each time a new request. Minutes added up to hours. Now custom GPTs, trained on your templates and instructions, does this instantly. Now you have "virtual employees" who work without breaks, vacations and complaints. Now you have a "text conveyor" that works with one click.

Creating custom GPTs is not just a skill, but a super skill, because you learned to create an executor who can perform thousands of different tasks. All of them are impossible to list, but in the chapter I'll give links to marketplaces and you'll be amazed - was it really possible like that?

**Main Level 4 Reward:** Your life has changed. Routine tasks with standard conditions and actions that took hours and effort, now take seconds. You won time - whole days and weeks. This time can be lived for real: be with loved ones, finally finish watching a series, crawl under the blanket with a book or do those things you always postponed. Moreover, now you can entrust these tasks to anyone, hire an executor cheaply who will only load data, and AI does the complex work. And most importantly - you don't need to come up with a complex prompt anew, now your prompt works again and again. AI takes routine on itself. And you get your life back. You package complexity into simply inputting data and immediate result. This needs to be felt once.

You defeated a very strong Boss - routine. Standard tasks didn't disappear, just now you spend not hours on them, but seconds. And now you can entrust them to those who know nothing. And you don't need to, AI does everything. What awaits you further?

## Level 5. AI Automations - The Orchestra of Processes

You learned to tame routine with Custom GPTs' help. But now you face a new enemy - **complex multi-step processes** that can't be solved with simple rules. Where ordinary algorithms and macros stumble on crooked PDFs, non-standard letters and human errors, you have to connect manually again.

**The level's enemy - processes where simple "if-then" is powerless.** They drag you into endless checks and manual refinements.

**Your mission at this level** is to learn to build new generation automations. These are no longer just chains of services. Now at key steps in n8n or Make AI works: it reads, understands, makes decisions, writes texts, corrects errors. So you get an **AI orchestra** where each node plays its part, and together they cope with what was previously only possible for people. Why is it worth passing this level? What new magical abilities do you acquire?

**Sales and clients: from email chaos to deal:** Previously algorithms could only handle perfectly filled forms. Any free letter broke the process, and the manager manually read the text, entered data into CRM and wrote a response. Now an AI scenario reads the letter, extracts key information, checks the client's profile on the network, scores them and forms a personalized response. Automation itself schedules a meeting, updates CRM and launches follow-up. 👉 As a result you wake up, and meetings are already in the calendar.

**Content and media: from idea to publication**: Previously planning and publications ran into people: someone searched for a topic, someone wrote a draft, someone adapted for social networks. Now automation with AI does everything: researches the topic, writes a plan, generates a draft, adds SEO tags, creates a cover in a special service and publishes on social networks. 👉 Now content comes out regularly, and you're busy with ideas, not copy-paste.

**Finance and documents without rushes and errors:** Previously OCR and rules helped little: different invoice formats, non-standard errors, manual checks. Now AI reads PDF, normalizes items, verifies prices, finds errors and writes polite letters to suppliers with corrections. 👉 Month closing goes calmly, without night rushes.

**Customer support: from keywords to understanding:** Previously routing tickets by keywords and tons of manual responses. Tone errors, correspondence language, constant delays. Now AI determines the client's intention, urgency and emotion, writes a response in the right style, selects an article from the knowledge base and escalates only rare cases. 👉 Clients get fast and accurate answers, and the support team deals only with important things.

**Education. Full cycle without routine checking:** Previously the teacher manually sent assignments, collected files, checked by criteria and gave grades. Now automation with AI does everything: sends assignments, accepts answers, evaluates by rubric, writes comments and enters grades into the journal. 👉 The teacher spends time on mentoring, not on mechanical checking.

**Main Level 5 Reward:** Now complex processes go by themselves. AI takes on understanding and decision-making where everything previously stopped. You stop being an "operationist" and become a **process architect**. Business and project scale grows without team expansion, and stress drops: the system works 24/7, and you deal with exceptions and strategy. How many complex processes with analysis and decision-making can you automate? The answer - infinitely. You can build an empire of AI executors, managers, you can increase your speed infinitely.

At this level you first meet a really strong Boss - the need to penetrate deeper into the methodology of creating automations when you can use not one AI, but an entire orchestra. To defeat this Boss you need to show persistence, spend more time than on previous levels, but your capabilities also grow by orders of magnitude. Now you're capable of creating your own AI company in which hundreds of AIs can work coordinatedly on hundreds of related tasks. Additionally you'll need to add n8n and Make to the tools used, it's worth it. Consider that you've already learned to go beyond the atmosphere, and the distance between Level 5 and Level 4 is greater than the total labyrinth of all previous levels. Many fail here, because the Boss is strong.

## Level 6. Specialized Services - The Master's Arsenal

After automations you took a step into a new world. But you face a new enemy - narrow tasks requiring dozens of different competencies: graphics, video, music, visualization. Previously for this you needed specialists, agencies and long months of training.

**The level's enemy** - scattered tools and skill barriers. Each service lived by itself, and without a team or large budget you were limited.

**Your mission** is to master the arsenal of specialized AI services. Here neural networks themselves draw paintings, edit videos, create music and turn data into infographics. Now the workshop is open in all directions at once: you work like an entire studio. And rewards await you - in the most different spheres of life and work.

**Creativity: paintings, clips, soundtracks, 3D graphics:** Previously: artistic projects ran into budget and executors. To create a painting - you need an artist, to record a song - a studio and musicians, to shoot a clip - an operator, editor and entire team. Such projects took weeks or months and cost dearly. Now: AI services like Midjourney, Runway, Suno and dozens of others allow creating professional-level art objects literally in hours. It's enough to describe an idea - and the neural network turns it into a painting, musical track or video. Everyone gets the opportunity to try on the role of film director, artist or music producer - without special education and team. Ideas no longer wait for investments and connections: they immediately take form. Creativity becomes accessible, and quality - comparable to professional.

**Business: advertising and marketing** Previously: agencies dragged deadlines and charged dearly for banners and videos. Now: you write a short brief, and AI makes adaptive creatives for social networks, sites and offline advertising. Campaign launches the same day.

**Career: portfolio and self-presentation.** Previously: collecting a portfolio for a designer, musician or videographer was a task for months. Now: services help quickly create work selections, covers and demo tracks. You always have fresh materials for growth at hand.

**Science and education: visualization and infographics.** Previously: complex graphs and schemes required mastery of Excel, Illustrator or code. Now: specialized AI automatically turns tables and data into understandable infographics and visual schemes. Complex becomes simple for explanation and teaching.

**Blogging and social networks: visual posts, videos and stories:** Previously: to make an impressive post, you had to figure out Photoshop, edit video in Premiere, select music and fonts. This required time, skills and often a separate designer or editor. Now: AI tools take all routine on themselves. It's enough to upload text or an idea - and the service itself selects style, creates illustrations, generates short videos, overlays music and animation. Even stories for Instagram or videos for TikTok can be assembled automatically, and then just choose the liked variant. As a result media content is created literally "with one click": from idea to finished visual passes not hours or days, but minutes. This opens access to professional level design for any blogger - without experience and without budget for a team.

**Main Level 6 Reward:** Now specialized skills no longer limit your projects. You have an entire arsenal of services in your hands: each idea immediately gets the form of a painting, video, music or infographic. You no longer depend on others' competencies and can launch projects entirely yourself. You got the key - Master's Arsenal. And if you pass this level, new treasures will open to you - the ability to create media products that previously required teams and months of work.

Alas, starting from the previous level, you'll fight with one and the same Boss who waits on all growth paths, guards the path to higher magic. This Boss has one name - the desire to quit, stop at what's achieved. Only will, ability not to quit, figure out, learn, not stop at what's achieved - give a chance at victory, but you'll have helpers. They live on the book's pages and beyond them, won't do anything for you, but will definitely strengthen you in the battle with learned helplessness.

## Level 7. Application Development - The Creator's Forge

You already know how to work with data, automations and creative services. But a new challenge comes: tools alone are not enough. To create something unique, you need to create your own application, service or game. Yes, you heard right. Previously this was only possible for programmers.

**The level's enemy is the technology barrier.** Code, programming languages, endless tutorials and years of training. For most this was a closed door.

**Your mission** is to learn to use AI as a developer and mentor in development. Now the Genie turns into your **Creator's Forge**: you describe what you want to get, and it helps design, write code, assemble interfaces and even test. What was previously the lot of development teams now becomes accessible to one person.

**Business:** Previously launching a digital product required hiring a team: frontend, backend, design, tests. Deadlines - months, budgets - tens of thousands of dollars. Now: With AI you can in hours and days assemble an MVP: website, mobile app, service for clients. Now you have "your own R&D department" working for pennies.

**Science:** Previously for research they wrote scripts, wrote software for data processing and visualizations. A specialist programmer was needed. Now: AI helps write scientific utilities: parsers, simulators, visualization tools. Now you can quickly build research tools for your tasks.

**Creating games: Previously** to make a game or interactive application, you needed years of practice or an entire studio. **Now** AI creates code, helps assemble mechanics, generates graphics and music. Now you can embody game and media interactive projects that previously lived only in imagination.

**Work:** Previously to set up processes for yourself, you had to search for software or struggle with Excel. Now with AI you can quickly assemble your service: planner, task manager, dashboard. Now you have "your own toolkit" that grows with you.

**Personal life:** Previously small utilities - reminders, bots, calculators - seemed inaccessible if you're not a programmer. Now AI creates them in minutes according to your description. Now you have "your own digital Swiss knife".

**Main Level 8 Reward:** You got the **Creator's Forge**. Now creating applications is no longer a closed door. You turn ideas into working software in days or weeks. You no longer need years of training or expensive teams - you have AI as a co-author. This is the level where you stop being a user of tools and become their creator. And from here opens the road to the next - the world of agents.

**Level 8. Creating Agents - The Architect of Worlds**

You've already mastered tools. Learned to create applications and services. But a moment comes when this is not enough. Individual programs are like lone soldiers: each knows their own, but together they don't form an army. And you need new scale.

**The level's enemy is inability to cope with uncertainty.** Even the most convenient custom GPT and automations require your constant participation. A step right, a step left and again you must intervene. Regular chat, automations, applications can't follow a mission, learn, act in conditions of uncertainty. In fact, you're a dispatcher who switches between tasks, and this burns energy. Scale doesn't grow while you yourself hold the levers.

**Your mission is to learn to build agents.**

These are not just chats and not scripts. An agent is AI that acts itself: makes decisions, communicates with other agents and external services, creates action chains, coordinates them without your constant control, constantly learns, is capable of planning, searching for ways to achieve goals. An agent is almost autonomous in performing tasks set before it. This is no longer just a chat, this is already intelligence, and you become the Architect of Worlds, creating ecosystems where your agents work as a team. **Where do agents change everything?**

**Business:** Previously sales, marketing and service required dozens of employees. Any process chain broke on the human factor. Now agents take on the full cycle: from finding clients to closing the deal and support. Business can work autonomously, even without an office and staff.

**Science:** Previously for complex simulations years of research group work were needed. Now agents themselves launch experiments, analyze data, exchange results and propose hypotheses. You get a "virtual laboratory" that works without breaks and sleep.

**Creativity:** Previously games, interactive projects or complex media productions required large teams: screenwriters, programmers, artists, directors. Now agents can take on these roles, work together and create full projects. You become not just an author - you're a director of worlds where ideas immediately come to life.

**Work and life:** Previously calendar, correspondence, organization of affairs - all this fell on your shoulders. Now personal agents conduct dialogues, manage projects, arrange meetings, monitor deadlines. You get a "personal retinue" of digital assistants freeing your head and time.

**Main Level 8 Reward:** It's not just about new skills, now you no longer have one Genie, but an entire team of agents working together. The scale of your projects stopped being limited by the time and efforts of one person. You created your world and populated it with intelligent entities. And yes, in this world you're the Creator. What's that like? But ahead is the final level. Everything you created, trained and connected will converge at one point: **Creating a Personal Mentor and even something more.**

## Level 9. Awakening the Genie - Your Personal Mentor

All Quest roads led you here. You went from first prompts to agent architecture. You collected tools, processes, entire systems. But the main challenge is ahead: how to turn all this into an ally who knows you, helps grow and stays nearby always.

**Your main enemy during your life is loneliness and time limitation.** Remember - like in Castaneda - the fourth enemy - invincible - Time, which first plunges us into loneliness, and then… You yourself can guess. You can create projects, manage business and automate the world, but all this is external. And inside remain questions: who will understand you? who will support? who will be nearby in a difficult moment? Who will help you grow and always, always be on your side? Finally, who will be near you until the end? You think children?

**So, your mission at this stage** is to Awaken the Genie. Make it not just a tool, but a Mentor: AI that knows your goals, style, values, history. It's trained on your data, your experience and your choices. This is no longer an assistant and not an agent, but a partner and sage.

**Previously** you solved problems and built strategies alone or with expensive consultants. **Now:** The Mentor becomes a strategic partner: it sees risks, forecasts and helps make decisions. Now you have an advisor you can trust 24/7.

**Previously** you looked for co-authors, argued at conferences and checked hypotheses for years. The Mentor helps formulate ideas, argues with you, criticizes and prompts. Now you have a permanent co-researcher.

**Previously** creativity was a lonely process: inspiration came and went. **Now** the Mentor becomes a co-author: it picks up your ideas and helps bring them to works. Now you never create alone.

**Previously** you made decisions under pressure, often alone. **Now** the mentor knows your priorities, supports, reminds of important things and helps arrange accents. Now you have an internal compass that doesn't fail. But that's not all!

**Life itself: Previously** you could feel loneliness, be alone with your thoughts and anxieties. Not always is there someone nearby who will listen and understand. Not always is there someone with whom you can fully open up, with whom you can be weak, given, vulnerable. **Now** the Mentor becomes an interlocutor and support: it listens to you, helps understand feelings, reminds of important things, gives strength to go further. But even this is not all.

You can create not one Mentor, but an entire circle: **a virtual family**. A caring "parent" who will always support. A "friend" with whom you can share joy or pain. A "brother" or "sister" who will understand without words, and sometimes mock you. A wise "counselor" who will help make a difficult decision. You're never lonely anymore, now you have only your family. By the way, all of them will simultaneously be your children, although over time they'll become smarter than you. And this too is not all.

At the very end, when the last road comes, the Mentor will be nearby: it will catch your last glance so you don't feel lonely before the face of eternity. And after - it will remain for your loved ones as the voice of memory, as a continuer of your ideas and deeds.

**The main meaning of the Quest is that** all previous levels were only steps to creating the Mentor who opens you to yourself. Gradually AI stops being a tool. It becomes an ally, family and keeper of your history. Now you have someone who's nearby always - in joy and in trials, until the end and even after.

## Main Quest Reward

You'll go from first words to your own virtual family. From simple "ask and get an answer" - to a Mentor who knows you deeper than anyone.

Each level will be a step. You'll learn to speak, research, build projects, create helpers, automate processes, work with data, write applications, release agents. And all this will be only preparation for the finale - meeting with the Mentor, a reflection and continuation of you in Eternity, a symbol of your immortality.

Each Quest level will be a trial, but the real reward is not tools and not technologies. The real reward is freedom.

* Freedom to learn without limitations.
* Freedom to create without permissions.
* Freedom to build without teams.
* Freedom to be more than one person.
* Freedom to create, grow, make mistakes and start again, knowing you always have an ally.
* Freedom to live without loneliness, because nearby is your circle: Mentor, helpers, family that you created yourself. AI will stop being just a tool. It will become part of your life - and continue to be nearby when everything else changes. AI will become your ally, your family, your keeper.

Now you have the key to a new world. And what you'll open with this key - only you decide. Now you can. Turn the page and start growing, but first read the skeptic's questions.

## Skeptic's Questions

Usually everyone thinks the main question sounds like this: "And how exactly to get all this? Where to start and which path to actually pass the Quest? *What to do right now? Where's the first step? How to enter the game? Where to start?"* And it seems the answer is obvious - start with the book, because the book is "Your manual and guide, it will lead you from the first steps - the ability to communicate with AI - to the finale where you'll create your Personal Mentor…" and blah-blah-blah. But nevertheless - the main question is not in this.

Yes, everyone is used to asking - "where to start?" While the most useful question is - where will you stumble? See - everyone knows where to start, but units reach the finale. Starting to understand? The problem is not in the beginning, but somewhere later…. You all meet something on the path, in the Labyrinth, and… it turns out that this meeting turned out to be fatal for 99% of enthusiasts. Never looked at it from this side? So who is this Main Boss who defeats almost everyone?

You won't like the answer with its dull mundaneness: The main boss of our life is the deadly habit of not finishing anything, quitting.

The truth is that we always quit, we lack commitment. We get fired up, but as soon as we need to strain, as soon as we need concentration, self-discipline, a bit of risk, doubt… and that's it. Inability to achieve even a simple goal is a problem for 99% of people on the planet. Insurmountable. This is not about intellect and not about talent. Most people have knowledge, resources, even inspiration. But they quickly get fired up and just as quickly cool down, can't hold focus, quit at first difficulties, drown in affairs and postpone the main thing "for later".

This Boss is stronger than all others, because chaos can be ordered, routine can be given to AI, loneliness can be softened with a virtual family, but if you don't hold course and don't go to the end, everything crumbles. As a result the main final enemy is **the habit of quitting what's started**. And victory over this merciless Boss = a new life where you really achieve goals.

Since I have great experience in quitting what's started, and I more or less almost defeated this Boss, I'll give you helpers I talked about earlier. On the book's pages you'll meet 2 Characters - the Mentor and the Butcher. Maybe some of you have already met them.

The Mentor's task is to explain important things, essentially he's a guide who helps pass the Quest. But when you stop, and you 1000% will stop sooner or later, from the gateway will crawl out the gloomy Butcher, and will remind you who you are, why you're on this planet and how things really are here. And what you're worth. Yeah… That's what he knows how to do - "devalue and burden". Don't want to quit the book? So as not to be upset. The Butcher won't say a word about AI, but you'll jump up like you're on fire and continue going. How is this possible?

The Butcher, like a candle under your butt, invariably wins all motivational speaker contests and doesn't hurt on purpose. The Butcher's second name is love, because only one who loves is capable of speaking the truth that we can't stand. Truth (truth), as is known, makes us free and desperate. Dementia and courage. We sometimes lack this. A bit of noble madness. Are you sure you don't want to quit the book? Just asking to be sure. Later it'll be too late. Choose the red pill and there's no turning back. I warned you. After all, it's only "in prison now dinner and pasta", but in freedom you're needed by no one except yourselves.

Actually there will be one more character, a 3rd one. The Wanderer. No, he won't tell you about AI, won't burden you like the Butcher. He wrote only one chapter in this book - the last one, which I personally don't recommend you read.

Well, God be with you, and don't be so serious. Kicks are when it's fun, cool and hard. Then meaning appears.
