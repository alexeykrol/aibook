**Level 1. The Art of Communication — The Genie's Gates (AI)**

You stand at the very first gates. Inside you — a thirst to learn, create, change your life. You are full of enthusiasm and anticipation, **but there's a problem**:

You don't know how to talk to the Genie. You ask — he answers nonsense, acts dumb. You request — he doesn't understand. You think that "you just need to ask a question," and here you encounter your first enemy — your own vagueness, the habit of thinking in half-words and being lazy about formulating clearly.

You don't know how to speak the language of AI, don't know what to expect from it. You're disappointed.

At this level, your mission is to master **the art of incantations (the art of creating powerful prompts)**. You must learn to formulate prompts so that the Genie (AI) executes them precisely, rather than turning them into a distorted mirror. This seems trivial, but this is exactly where most people fail. Those who don't pass will remain ordinary users, complaining: "AI is dumb." But if you triumph, you'll earn your first **magical arts in your treasury**. What prizes await you if you pass this Level?

**Rapid learning and instant understanding:** What used to take years now fits into weeks or days. This is your first chest of gold: knowledge without boundaries. You understand how to overcome AI hallucinations, how to avoid its sycophancy. Suddenly and immediately, AI transforms into a serious and thoughtful teacher on any subject. The quality of answers you receive from AI will change radically, and enlightenment awaits you. Now you can learn at a comfortable pace, get explanations at your level, instantly test yourself and receive feedback. What previously required a tutor or courses has become available to everyone.

**Understanding your health:** You can upload examination results, analyze doctors' conclusions, compare symptoms and find possible causes — all of this was previously inaccessible without medical education. AI will analyze your data in seconds, compare dozens of conclusions and build personalized nutrition and training plans. You have an entire clinic in your phone, available 24/7. This isn't just process acceleration — it's a new level of control over your body. You no longer wait for appointments, don't pay for each consultation. You have an expert who's always nearby. You save weeks of waiting and thousands of dollars. Now your health is in your hands like never before. This is your shield against fear and doubt.

**Managing your wellbeing:** Previously, you needed to consult a trainer or keep a journal manually. Now AI can build your personalized training and nutrition plans and track progress automatically.

**Job searching:** You can analyze hundreds of vacancies 100 times faster, prepare professional resumes for each individual vacancy in seconds, create a portfolio and even practice passing interviews with AI's help.

**Creating texts.** Previously, writing articles, books or dissertations was long labor. Writing letters, articles and reports took hours and days. Now you can create professional-quality texts in hours, and most importantly — write in genres where you have no experience.

**Translations and transcriptions.** Previously, quality translation was the domain of professionals. Now anyone can get translations and transcriptions in real time.

**Analysis and creation of legal documents.** Previously, analyzing and drafting contracts required a lawyer and took much time. Now you can independently prepare a huge project of documents in minutes.

**Creating images:** Previously, to draw a picture, you needed talent or years of practice. Most people didn't even try. You can create cool pictures right now. Creativity becomes available to everyone willing to master the right prompt. This is your spark of inspiration that ignites a new "you."

**Creating music.** Previously, composing music required knowledge and instruments. Now you can create songs, arrangements and even symphonies.

**Main Level Reward:** You've mastered the language of communication with the Genie (AI), now AI understands and listens to you. You've already gained an advantage, now you're capable of getting 100 times more with AI's help than 99% of Earth's population.

You defeated the main boss, and no, this Boss isn't AI at all, because all the bosses you'll have to defeat in the Quest don't live in AI, but within us. Having passed this level, you received the main revelation: **The quality of AI's answers depends only on the quality of questions, i.e., only on how you learned to create powerful prompts.**

But what rewards and trials await us at Level 2? What can we achieve by taking a few more steps in our Quest?
