**Level 2. The Art of Research — The Labyrinth of Knowledge**

You've passed through the first gates. Now AI listens to you and responds more clearly. But suddenly you notice that AI often lies in its answers, and you need facts and references. Also, AI gives only a piece, but you need a whole, comprehensive puzzle. You want not just to hear, but **to understand in depth**, compare sources, find truth among noise. But that's not all. You need to research many sources, hundreds of them, you need overviews, comparisons — and how to deal with this? Sit for hours asking questions, then double-checking answers, then compiling?

Or you needed to understand how your competitors operate, what strategies they use, what they emphasize. You spent hours, and sometimes days, reviewing sites, reports, reviews and articles, but each time felt you were missing something? You tried to build a marketing strategy, studied the market, target audience, looked at competitors' successful cases. But the information was fragmented, data became outdated, and trends changed too quickly?

When you worked on a scientific review, you had to manually search for articles, check their relevance, figure out complex terms? Or maybe you thought about investing in several companies but had doubts? Financial analytics seemed complicated, you were afraid of missing important nuances.

You understand that when you face a complex, sophisticated task requiring many steps, fact-checking, references, analysis, the usual question-answer mode with AI doesn't work. You clearly need something more.

Yes, that's right, and at this level your mission is to learn to set **multi-step tasks**. This is no longer just one question — one answer. This is a journey through the labyrinth of knowledge, where you need to know how to ask clarifications, build chains, gather facts into a system. The first enemy here is the illusion of simplicity. It seems the Genie knows everything. But the truth is that he can make mistakes or answer too generally. And your strength is being able to dig deeper, verify, compare. If you give up — you'll remain on the surface. If you pass — you'll receive **new treasures** that open doors to science, business and career. At this level you'll master Deep Research mode, and new magical skills await you:

**Fact-checking:** Previously, you had to spend hundreds of hours clarifying facts, references, citations. Tedious, exhausting work. With AI on board, you get all links, facts with explanations and comments. You can insert them into your dissertation immediately.

**Writing scientific articles, treatises, dissertations:** You need to prepare a structured document with problem statement, detailed analysis, reasoning, article reviews and references? How much time did you spend on this? Months? AI will do everything for you in 30-40 minutes of any volume.

**Analysis of tenders, proposals, article reviews, finding the best offer:** Previously, to make a topic review, you needed months to read dozens of articles and books, research vacancies, resumes, offer sites, thousands of articles. This was only possible for researchers and students. Reviewing hundreds of sources required months. Now with AI you can gather a systematic review in 30 minutes(!): dozens of sources, key arguments, critical comparison. You see the whole picture, as if you have your own personal research team. This is your torch in the labyrinth of knowledge.

**Market analysis:** Previously, to understand the market, you needed to hire analysts, order reports, spend weeks and money. Now AI analyzes competitors in hours, forecasts trends and produces comparison tables. You get information that previously cost thousands of dollars. This is your chest of gold coins for strategies.

**Career, vacancy analysis:** Previously, to understand a new industry or profession, you spent months reading articles, wandering forums, asking acquaintances questions. Now AI helps you understand the profession's structure, key skills, and prospects in 10 minutes. You immediately see the map of the territory. This is your compass for your career path.

**Document comparison:** You needed to compare dozens of documents, articles, contracts, get an extract, comparative analysis and report? Usually — several months. With AI — 20-30 minutes. No violinist needed!

**Main Level 2 Reward:** You've mastered the art of collecting, analyzing and compiling unlimited volumes of information 1000 times faster. Now the Genie for you is not only an interlocutor, but also an analyst, critic and advisor. You see depth, understand connections, can verify and compare. Most importantly — you save thousands of hours of precious time and tens of thousands of dollars. From now on, you need no one to get outstanding analytical data without asking anyone.

**You defeated the next boss and received the next revelation:** The right prompt aimed at research + Deep Research mode gives results that make you break into a sweat. And get goosebumps from realizing the prospects. Your understanding of what's worth spending time on in analysis and research has completely changed.

You extracted from the labyrinth a torch, compass, chest, amulet and shield. With these artifacts, you're ready to go further — to Level 3.
