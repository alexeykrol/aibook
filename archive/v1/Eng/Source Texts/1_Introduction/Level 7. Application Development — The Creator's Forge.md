**Level 7. Application Development — The Creator's Forge**

You already know how to work with data, automations and creative services. But a new challenge comes: tools alone aren't enough. To create something unique, you need to create your own application, service or game. Yes, you heard right. Previously, this was only within the capability of programmers.

**The level's enemy — the technology barrier.** Code, programming languages, endless tutorials and years of training. For most people, this was a closed door.

**Your mission** is to learn to use AI as a developer and mentor in development. Now the Genie transforms into your **Creator's Forge**: you describe what you want to get, and he helps design, write code, assemble interfaces and even test. What was previously the domain of development teams now becomes accessible to one person.

**Business:** Previously, launching a digital product required hiring a team: frontend, backend, design, testing. Timelines — months, budgets — tens of thousands of dollars. Now: With AI you can assemble an MVP in hours and days: a website, mobile application, client service. Now you have your "own R&D department" working for pennies.

**Science:** Previously, for research they wrote scripts, wrote software for data processing and visualizations. A programmer specialist was needed. Now: AI helps write scientific utilities: parsers, simulators, visualization tools. Now you can quickly build research tools for your tasks.

**Creating games: Previously** to make a game or interactive application, you needed years of practice or an entire studio. **Now** AI creates code, helps assemble mechanics, generates graphics and music. Now you can embody game and interactive media projects that previously lived only in imagination.

**Work:** Previously, to set up processes for yourself, you had to search for software or struggle with Excel. Now with AI you can quickly assemble your service: scheduler, task manager, dashboard. Now you have "your own toolkit" that grows with you.

**Personal life:** Previously, small utilities — reminders, bots, calculators — seemed inaccessible if you weren't a programmer. Now AI creates them in minutes according to your description. Now you have "your own digital Swiss knife."

**Main Level 8 Reward:** You've received the **Creator's Forge**. Now creating applications is no longer a closed door. You turn ideas into working software in days or weeks. You no longer need years of training or expensive teams — you have AI as a co-author. This is the level where you stop being a tool user and become their creator. And from here opens the road to the next — the world of agents.
