"THE FASTEST WAY TO GET A JOB IS TO STUDY AI" © Naval Ravikant

In March 2025, I had 40 thousand subscribers on FB, now more than 120 thousand and 1-2 thousand are added every day. How did this happen? I simply shared an observation that in a couple of years some people will have smart AI, and others will have dumb AI. Questions poured in: "What should I do to have smart AI and not dumb?" The answer was not so simple, and I made a short free course where I talked about how I communicate with AI and grow it into a genius digital child. Taking money for this seemed shameful to me.

As a result, in a month more than 15 thousand people completed the course and people left more than 1000 reviews. Many times they asked me to write a book. I perceived the idea with interest and thought it was worth explaining the technology to people, making something like a manual.

How wrong I was! Everything was wrong. I wasn't grasping something, so I started reading the reviews. I read all 1000+ reviews, and my eyes opened. I saw what triggered people the most, I saw that very "Aha moment!" that literally blew their minds. It turned out that people absolutely don't need manuals and knowledge. All that people really need is hope, a motivational kick that will open the gates. And then people are capable of learning anything themselves. This is especially strongly indicated by the fact that artificial intelligence is the best Teacher on the planet.

I thought for a long time about what to include in the book and what not. There's always the temptation to give as much as possible. But here too the reviews helped: it turned out that only a few key moments give that very "Aha effect." Why? Because if learning goes on for a long time and understanding arises slowly — no explosion of consciousness occurs. But when they show you some completely tiny detail, and you unexpectedly see how many opportunities you have under your nose, how you underestimated them — doubts disappear instantly.

This is a specific trigger. It turns you from a doubting skeptic into a burning adept. Not because someone convinced you of something, but because you yourself saw, tried for five seconds — and an abyss opened before you. You went cold, broke out in sweat, tears appeared in your eyes — at this moment a miracle happens. All the ideas that have been coming to you for years but weren't realized for a million reasons — because there was no knowledge, time, helpers, team, money — all these ideas suddenly wake up. And they tell you: "Now you can." And you understand: yes, I can.

You suddenly become a wizard quickly and easily. Just because you mastered several basic things. I don't talk about how AI works. I only show how I myself use AI, what I, and therefore you, can do. And people have their minds blown! I show and tell those very "non-secret" secrets that we never see because they lie under our nose. Because we seek useless complexity. It turned out that you don't need to stuff a lot into the book. A few basic approaches are enough, and they change consciousness, people start learning themselves — greedily, fanatically, everywhere they can. After all, the whole paradigm of modern education still consists in finding an expert, signing up for courses, paying money... And you believe in this, but as soon as you master the basics, it releases you. Now you understand that you no longer need universities or courses, nothing at all. You already know how to do everything. You can get an answer to any question. If not immediately — ask again.

Artificial intelligence is that very friend, mentor, teacher with whom you can do anything you want. It will be with you until the end of life. It won't betray you. Nothing more powerful in human history has existed. And all you need is to reach out your hand, read the book you're holding, take a couple of steps. Literally today, right now. Everything is described step by step. Start reading the first couple of chapters, start doing. It will take 15 minutes — and your mind will explode. Your pressure will rise, your heartbeat will quicken, you'll want to sit down or lie down. I'm speaking precisely because this happened to me many times. And to a huge number of people — too. What is happening now is a revolution. But this revolution will be kind to those who started moving. No need to be a religious fanatic and naive. I always tell people: don't believe — just check. It will take a few minutes.

However, the book goes further, because in some sense artificial intelligence is no different from a person. Want to get a clear answer from AI? Learn to ask the right questions. This is a fundamental skill, and it's precisely when working with AI that you hone it so strongly that you gradually learn to ask truly important questions. And to whom do you ask them? Your AI? No. You will start asking questions to yourself, especially questions you're afraid of. And then you start getting answers that open doors that were previously tightly closed. "We are rich in answers but poor in questions." Or, as Heidegger says: "The question is the piety of thinking."

AI is not another new fashionable technology, but new good news "Now You Can!" Now you can dream again, want, create, do, achieve. Now you're young again, now all paths are open to you again. Career, business, creativity, technology, science. Now you can do what you didn't dare think about. Now you can learn - everything you wish. And even now you can do everything, even if you're alone.
