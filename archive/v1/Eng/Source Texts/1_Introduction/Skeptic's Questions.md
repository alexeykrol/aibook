Skeptic's Questions

Usually everyone thinks the main question sounds like this: "How exactly to get all this? Where to start and what path to really pass the Quest? *What should I do right now? Where's the first step? How to enter the game? Where to start?*" And it seems the answer is obvious - start with the book, because the book is "Your manual and guide, it will lead you from the first steps - the ability to communicate with AI - to the finale, where you'll create your Personal Mentor..." and blah-blah-blah. But nevertheless - the main question is not in this.

Yes, everyone is used to asking - "where to start?" While the most useful question is - where will you stumble? You see - everyone knows where to start, but only a few reach the finish. Starting to understand? The problem is not in the beginning, but where then... You all meet something on the way, in the Labyrinth, and... it turns out that this meeting turned out to be fatal for 99% of enthusiasts. Never looked from this side? So who is this Main Boss that defeats almost everyone?

You won't like the answer for its dull mundanity: The main boss of our life is the deadly habit of not finishing anything, quitting.

The truth is that we always quit, we lack commitment. We flare up, but as soon as we need to strain, as soon as we need concentration, self-discipline, a bit of risk, doubt... and that's it. The inability to achieve even a simple goal is a problem for 99% of people on the planet. Insurmountable. It's not about intellect and not about talent. Most people have knowledge, resources, even inspiration. But they quickly flare up and just as quickly cool down, can't hold focus, quit at the first difficulties, drown in matters and postpone the main thing "for later."

This Boss is stronger than all the rest, because chaos can be ordered, routine can be given to AI, loneliness can be softened by virtual family, but if you don't hold the course and don't go to the end, everything falls apart. In the end, the main final enemy is the **habit of abandoning what you started**. And victory over this merciless Boss = new life where you really achieve goals.

Since I have great experience in abandoning what I started, and I more or less almost defeated this Boss, I'll give you helpers I talked about earlier. On the pages of the book you'll meet 2 Characters - the Mentor and the Butcher. Maybe some of you have already met them.

The Mentor's task is to explain what's important, essentially he's a guide who helps pass the Quest. But when you stop, and you will 1000% sooner or later stop, the gloomy Butcher will crawl out of the gateway and remind you who you are, what you're on this planet for and how things really are here. And what you're worth. Aha... That's what he knows how to do - "devalue and burden." Don't want to abandon the book? So as not to get upset. The Butcher won't say a word about AI, but you'll jump up like you've been blown up and continue going. How is this possible?

The Butcher, like a candle under your butt, invariably wins all motivational speaker contests and doesn't hurt on purpose. The Butcher's second name is love, because only one who loves is capable of speaking the truth that we can't stand. Truth, as you know, makes us free and desperate. Folly and bravery. We sometimes lack this. A bit of noble madness. Really don't want to abandon the book? Just asking, just in case. It will be too late later. Choose the red pill and there's no turning back. I warned you. After all, it's only "in prison now dinner and pasta," but in freedom you're not needed by anyone except yourself.

Actually there will be one more character, the 3rd. Wanderer. No, he won't tell you about AI, won't burden you like the Butcher. He wrote only one chapter in this book - the last one, which I personally don't recommend you read.

Well, with God, and don't be so serious. Fun is when it's fun, cool and hard. That's when meaning appears.
