**1. Which AI is Better to Choose?**

The first and obvious question that haunts a beginner, who decided to finally figure out this AI stuff — which AI to choose? From OpenAI, from Google, from Anthropic, DeepSeek? Which image generator to use? Midjourney or Stable Diffusion? Video generator? Music generator? Code generation? Where to start?!

It's easy to get confused. But that's why I'm here — to throw you a life buoy and give you the safest path that 100% guarantees you'll get results without getting lost in this jungle.

**The answer is super simple: start with chatGPT and nowhere else.**

Not because chatGPT is better than everyone else or inferior to someone. It's just that chatGPT from OpenAI is, you could say, the absolute king of models right now. It's the leader used by billions of people and leading corporations on the planet. If you master chatGPT, you'll be able to use any model — they're all similar.

However, please note, I don't forbid you from playing with all sorts of other things, and when you're experienced, you'll actually use different models or even use them together. And there's an ocean of cool services, different types of functionality, specialized capabilities — all very useful and cool, but first you need to master the basics.

Take a car. When a person learns to drive, it doesn't matter what car they learn on: Honda, Toyota, Mercedes — the difference doesn't matter much. But once you've learned to drive on one, you can drive any. The transition is simple: a couple of minutes to adapt to the interior — and that's it, you can go. The same with AI.

AI is a tool. Like a car. If you learn the basics, understand how it works, then mastering another model will be easy. That's exactly why we'll work with chatGPT.

**It's the best that currently exists in the world for the price-quality ratio.**

When OpenAI released its new models, they significantly surpassed everyone, and perhaps only Anthropic's Claude model is close in terms of intellectual power, and the Chinese models for work in coding and specialized tasks are good, but for what we need, we focus on OpenAI chatGPT (GPT-4o, GPT-5, o3, o4-mini and others) for the following reasons.

1. ChatGPT is the most understandable, easy to use.
2. It's the most popular: the largest number of people use it, which means 99% of examples, guides, explanations and materials on the internet are about chatGPT. Plus, chatGPT is integrated into a huge number of digital services and applications.
3. OpenAI is the acknowledged leader in AI, and their models are simply top-notch.
4. ChatGPT has the widest functionality. Understand, OpenAI has not only the best models but also the largest number of opportunities. You can connect chatGPT to many services.
5. ChatGPT gives the possibility to solve 90% of all tasks of any user who ever approaches AI. In the future, you'll understand this from the list I'll give you.
6. Most importantly: the main skill — interaction with chatGPT and understanding all its capabilities — is transferable and universal. Once you master chatGPT, you'll be able to quickly understand other AI models, as the basic principles are the same. Just as a person who learned to drive a Honda can quickly adapt to a Mercedes.

But there's more nuance. You need a paid plan, this is a mandatory necessary investment. When you pay for chatGPT, you get a tool, a car, a well-maintained starship, not a wreck. That is, it seems like chatGPT is free, there's a free plan, and you can use it — the quality is worse, but much worse and much more limited in many nuances. Therefore, consider that for chatGPT it's necessary to buy a paid plan chatGPT-PLUS, which is $20 per month, this is not a lot of money.

And you need to know that even the Plus plan has limitations (on the number of calls to the model). Therefore, the basic paid plan allows you to make a certain number of requests per 3-hour interval. For someone this is enough, for someone it's not. Therefore, there's an additional Pro plan for $200 per month. In 99% you won't need Pro, because unlike Plus you don't go from genius model to simply smart model, when you've used up requests.

In general, it's better to start with $20 per month. Do you want chatGPT PLUS for free? At the moment this is impossible. There are shared accounts, they cost around $1-2 per month, but there the experience will be crippled, which will in itself be a problem, because you pay for it with wasted time (days), disappointment and irritation.

This in itself is very unpleasant, right? Therefore, paid chatGPT is a serious, serious investment in yourself. For the price of 2-3 cappuccinos in a coffee shop, you get literally 10 times more capabilities. I'm not exaggerating.

The difference between free and paid is colossal. If it's the difference between you walking and a luxurious car, such is the difference. Trust me, after you start using paid chatGPT, you'll never want to go back to the free version. By the way, from time to time OpenAI runs promotions for a trial period of paid chatGPT for 1 month — for free. Take advantage if you see it.

Now you know which AI to choose and how to start: paid chatGPT for $20 per month (Plus). And it, like a well-maintained starship, will take us to the most distant reaches of the universe of possibilities, and in the next section we'll prepare this ship for flight.
