3. What You Need to Know? Basic Concepts, Terms and AI Concepts in Very Simple Language.

Since you're entering the unexplored realm of AI space, you'll encounter much that's new, and it's worth knowing in advance what and how. Don't worry - I'll introduce concepts in small doses, explain as clearly as possible and, most importantly, immediately read the "**Try it**" footnote and try it immediately.

1. **Chat** - the most familiar form of communicating with AI, like in a regular chat - in Telegram, Messenger or WhatsApp. You write a question, assignment, and AI responds.

2. **Prompt** - this is what your question or task for AI is called, which you write in chat. Everything you write in chat is called a *prompt*. This can be a request, instruction, question. **Important!** The quality of AI's response depends on the quality of your question. In 99% of cases AI doesn't "act dumb", people just write idiotic or incorrect requests.

Imagine: you're explaining to a person what you want. If you say "make it beautiful" - it'll turn out however. If you say "make a concert poster for 7-year-old children, with fairies and unicorns" - the result will be more precise. Why is it important to formulate prompts correctly? The clearer and more understandable you formulate the prompt, the better the answer.

3. **Model Selection**. Artificial intelligence is generally a popular term about nothing. More correctly to say - large language model or simply model. This is the "brain" that talks with you. **Important**! Further AI and model will be synonyms.

ChatGPT gives the ability to choose a model, because different models give different capabilities and abilities. Imagine: you came to a library, and you can be helped by either an intern or a professor. Both are friendly, but the professor knows more. When you choose a "model" - you choose the AI version that's answering "now". The model has a name (for example, GPT-4o or GPT-5, etc.), and the choice affects how smart, clear and accurate the model will answer. **Where to find model selection?** At the top of the chat there's a dropdown menu for model selection.

By default GPT-5 auto is set, if the question is simple - leave as is. If serious or important - choose the "smartest" available GPT-5-thinking (reasoning model, smartest, but thinks long), GPT-5-thinking-mini - thinks faster, but the model itself isn't as cool, GPT-5-instant - responds as fast as possible.

**Try it**: Enter the same serious prompt for GPT-5 auto and GPT-5-thinking models, and feel the difference. On simple requests (about pea soup) the difference is unnoticeable, but on complex requests requiring deep analysis - the difference is colossal.

4. **Hallucinations** - when AI lies... but not intentionally))) Imagine: a person speaks very confidently - but then it turns out they were mistaken. They didn't lie, they just made something up. Such a funny person - decided to fib, because they're "embarrassed" to show ignorance. It happens. Sometimes the model invents facts, dates or links that don't exist. This isn't deception - it's a "guess" when there's no precise information. In 99% of cases this happens due to a weak prompt and can be easily overcome. How?

1. Ask for sources. 2. Add the phrase: "If you're not sure - say so". 3. Check important details yourself. The model isn't God, can make mistakes - like a human. At least for now. Example: "Provide a link to the source" or "If you don't know exactly - write that you're not sure".

Now you know - if the model "acts dumb", then in 99% it's because you were too lazy to set the task correctly. Same with people. Some say so - "I don't know", but there are little liars. Nevertheless, if you give the model a correctly composed prompt, you'll always get a quality answer. And if fact checking is needed, you can use the service <https://www.perplexity.ai>, which uses known models, but is specially designed for internet search and fact-checking.

And if you need to get a simple explanation of something complex with source verification, you can use the Explainer service: <https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68eff875e0488191a2fbb05b766fe4ee-obiasniator>

**Try it**: Enter the same serious prompt without fact-checking and links and then repeat, adding to the prompt: "Provide a link to the source, conduct fact-checking, and if you don't know exactly - write that you're not sure".

5. **Model Memory** - so as not to repeat every time. Super important. Imagine: you're communicating with a personal assistant. One option - every time tell them your name, what you do and what you love. Another - they remembered it. ChatGPT can remember important things about you - for example, your name, that you prefer short answers, that you're writing a book. The model will consider your style, goals, interests. **Where to find Memory settings?** Settings → Personalization → Memory. There you can enable, disable, delete individual records. **Important**! Memory can also be managed right in chat, for example write "Remember that I like brief answers" or "Don't save this".

6. **Working with Images**. Imagine: you need to explain what's wrong in the layout, or what's depicted in a photo - and instead of words you just paste a picture in chat. ChatGPT can understand what's in the image, analyze, suggest, edit text on it. How to do this? You can simply "drag" a file from the computer with the mouse, or click the "paperclip" icon next to the input field - and upload a file. Example tasks: "What's depicted in this photo?", "Check errors in this infographic", "Make a caption for the picture".

ChatGPT can not only analyze pictures, but also create them based on your text. We'll talk about this in a separate chapter.

**Try it:** Take a screenshot in copy-to-buffer form (Copy), and paste into chat with Paste command or save to computer, and then drag with mouse right into chat, and then write a prompt with a request to analyze.

Wildly useful when you're figuring out something unclear on screen. Super useful for deciphering scribbles and doctors' diagnoses, analyzing X-rays, old photos.

7. **Integrations** - connecting your files (with caution). Imagine: you tell an assistant: "Look in this document on Google Drive and explain what's there". ChatGPT can get access to your files (for example, on Google Drive), if you allow it, to read documents, make summaries, help with analysis. Important! Allow only when needed. Give access only in "view only" mode. After work - disconnect access. **Where to look?** Settings → Apps and connectors. **To disconnect access?** "Disconnect" button and then in Google settings → Security.

8. **Chat History** - your personal library of dialogues. Very useful. All your conversations are usually saved, they can be reviewed, exported, deleted. Convenient to search past answers. You can make an archive or delete everything unnecessary. **Where to look?** left sidebar - History. **Important!** If something personal was discussed - just click "delete" or "export".

9. **Model Response Formats** - how exactly do you want to get the answer? Imagine: you ask an assistant "tell briefly" or "format in a table". The same can be said to AI. ChatGPT can present the answer as a list, table, instruction, comparison, etc. How to ask? Right in the prompt (request). Examples: "Format this as a comparison table", "Give step-by-step instructions", "Write in bullet points, in 5 items".

**Try it:** Ask to throw out 10 theses on a topic you need and output in table format.

10. **How to Start? First Steps.**

Artificial intelligence can become an excellent assistant, even if you're hearing about it for the first time and have no experience working with such technologies.

**Try it:** The simplest option is just to start a dialogue. Even if you don't have a clear understanding of how to use AI, you can ask it questions, for example: **"How to work with you?"** or **"Where to start?"** - and it will explain the basic principles. AI recognizes text in Russian language, even if there are errors in it.

The main rule - don't be afraid to experiment, click buttons and test capabilities. Mistakes in settings can be corrected, and nothing critical can be broken. When working with AI you can use voice mode, but its availability depends on browser and operating mode. For example, in some cases AI may not respond to voice commands due to microphone settings or browser operation features. This can be checked by trying different devices or restarting the communication session.

11. ChatGPT has **desktop and mobile** versions that can be downloaded and are especially convenient for voice communication.

**Try it:** Download the desktop version here and mobile version from your store (Apple Store or Google Play).
