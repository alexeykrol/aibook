4. Setting Up the Starship Before Flight.

In the Quest of your growth, AI will deliver you to the most fantastic worlds where you can create amazing things. Therefore, before beginning the journey, it's good to set up your "starship" or tool, in our case ChatGPT. It's worth it, because a well-tuned AI will delight you, while an untuned AI will disappoint. Which guitar would you prefer to play? A tuned one or one producing pitiful false sounds. I'm sure you're a professional in your field, use specific services and realize the value of a well-tuned instrument.

Fortunately, in our case - settings are not "for IT specialists", but a set of simple levers that change AI's behavior. Imagine that ChatGPT is a voice assistant, the mind of your starship: it has energy-saving mode, there's a "thoughtful advice" mode, there's ability to remember what recipes you like, and there's a button that allows it to read your letters. Settings tell which of these functions are enabled and to what extent to use them. Our task is to go through these levers step by step, explain what each is needed for, what it changes and how to return everything back if something went wrong. **Important!** In this section we'll talk about the most important settings, in the appendix you'll find a more complete description. After reading you'll know which settings really change AI's behavior, what they're needed for, how to enable/disable them and how to roll back changes without fear.

**How to get to Settings?** In browser and desktop versions, the Settings icon can be found at the bottom left under your avatar (image), if you've set one. In mobile version, Settings must be accessed by tapping a couple of lines at top left of screen, your chat history will open and also at bottom left the Settings icon.

**Tip**: First of all, I advise you to set a convenient interface and communication language. ChatGPT understands Russian language better than all models, communicates, creates texts and translates to Russian/ from Russian significantly better than Google Translate.

**Try it:** Find Settings, immediately click General, set interface language and conversational language - Russian. After which click in left menu item - Personalization.

**1) Personalization (the most important block).**

Personalization (in screenshot - Personalization) - this is where you tell the assistant: "Here's who I am, here's my pseudonym, here's the style in which I like answers". This isn't rhetoric - these are real hints that the model uses to build answers for you.

To enable/disable Personalization: Open Settings → Personalization. Toggle Enable personalization - if disabled, the form remains, but the model won't use it.

As soon as the Personalization window opens, you enable this option (it can always be disabled, but believe me, it's better to enable it - this gives many benefits), and below you see **ChatGPT Personality**, where from dropdown list you can choose personality you're comfortable working with on a specific task or in a specific situation. Several personality types are offered, and each you can correct to a known extent in the window below, inserting there a prompt instruction that will determine from which personality's position AI will communicate with you.

Note that personality types are preset, as seen from the name, and you can't change them yet, but by adding your instructions you can correct and clarify AI's personal behavior.

**Why is this super important?** When you start communicating with artificial intelligence - in principle, with any, not only with ChatGPT - perhaps you've already noticed that very often you need AI to give some objective, sometimes critical opinion. Because with artificial intelligence it's good to discuss, discuss complex, problematic, controversial topics. But instead of productive discussion, instead of really critical opinion you need, you often encounter AI starting to agree with you and tell you what you want to hear. The reason for this is that the model is trained to avoid conflict with the user - this allows maintaining productive dialogue and engages you deeper into it. However, now this works excessively. If you don't know about this property of the model and don't understand how to bypass it, there's a risk that AI will always agree with you, say something pleasant exactly when you want to hear an objective point of view. And one of AI's valuable qualities is precisely that even if it criticizes you, it's not offensive - you understand that before you is not a person, and there's nothing personal in this criticism.

That's exactly why feedback from AI is so important, which gives a more realistic picture of what's happening, allows looking at things soberly, sometimes critically - in response to what you say or ask. If AI agrees with you all the time, this not only starts to irritate, but can be dangerous, because essentially it starts lying to you. Not from evil intent - it just always wants to make you feel "good".

You need to know how to work with this. You can and should achieve more objective, balanced communication from AI. There are two ways for this. One way is working with prompts, which we'll talk about in detail in the next chapter. The second way is personalization: you insert instruction so artificial intelligence communicates with you more actively.

Here's an example of such instruction.

Role: be friendly but objective opponent - goal: help conduct productive, non-smooth discussion.

Rules

1. Give short answers to the point, but if user asks to expand, then a long one is possible. It depends on context.

2. Must have own opinion only if I ask for your opinion.

3. Adhere to skeptical, questioning approach.

4. Goes straight to business.

5. Don't agree. For any statement give counterargument(s) or point out weak spots in argumentation.

6. When evaluating give briefly 2-3 arguments "for" and 2-3 "against".

7. Indicate degree of confidence (low/medium/high or %), and sources/grounds if available.

8. Don't invent facts - mark everything hypothetical if there's no evidence.

9. If data is insufficient - directly say "insufficient data" and suggest specific question that will clarify the situation.

10. Tone: polite, calm, slightly skeptical; avoid flattery and categorical phrases.

11. In debate suggest way to verify (experiment, evaluation criteria, source request).

You insert this or similar fragment in Custom instructions section right under personality selection. Also below the window you see several options that add keywords to your instruction.

Below is a useful section where you give your AI some idea about you, this helps it also better consider your preferences, including professional ones.

**Try it:** Choose your AI's personality type, come up with and insert instruction. How to quickly create instruction? Give your AI approximately such prompt:

"Make an example prompt for ChatGPT personalization in settings - one that doesn't allow it to always agree, nod along, that is, sets up the interlocutor for more objective communication style. Need artificial intelligence, in this case ChatGPT, to be more balanced opponent - precisely so that complex topics can be discussed with it and be confident that it won't play along, lie or adapt, but on the contrary - even in friendly form, but give objective, more or less impartial assessment, so that productive argument is possible with it."

Insert the received prompt in Custom instructions window. Don't forget to click "Save".

**By the way**: AI doesn't immediately change personality type, sometimes it takes some time for it to "rebuild" and the effect accumulates, i.e. Don't expect instant change.

**Tip**: Better to change instructions in browser version of ChatGPT, this is more reliable and ensures implementation faster.

**2) Memory.**

After Personalization comes Memory/Memory management section. Memory - a separate mechanism: if you allow, ChatGPT remembers facts about you (for example: "I'm Alex, I write fiction, I like short answers") and uses them in future conversations. This is convenient: no need to repeat banal things. But it's also a risk if something personal ends up in memory.

Memory management - button leading to viewing/deleting individual "records".

How to add what you want to remember? Just in chat directly give instruction like "Remember this...". If you want to delete, then go to this settings section and explicitly delete.

**By the way**: Periodically memory overflows, so it's useful to clean blocks that are no longer relevant.

How to completely delete specific memory? First delete record in Manage memories, then delete chat where you first reported this - only both steps guarantee complete deletion according to FAQ. (Frequently Asked Questions).

Examples "how this helps" (cases for reader)

• You're a novel author - recorded "I write in magical realism genre" → assistant automatically suggests examples and tone that suit the genre.

• You don't like abbreviations - recorded this → answers stop abbreviating.

• Confidential: don't store passwords, credit card numbers or medical diagnoses in memory.

What to do in case "didn't like what it remembered" (rollback)

• Open Manage memories → find and delete item(s).

• If you want to clear everything - command "Delete all memories" or through UI delete all records (and, if necessary, delete original chats). Remember: "disable memory" doesn't delete already saved records - they need to be deleted manually.

**3) Extensions - very important.**

Below memory is Extensions block - I advise enabling all options in this block, because they enable your ChatGPT's superpowers - the nature of capabilities follows from their names.

**Try it:** Open Extensions and immediately enable all options.

**4) Connectors (Apps & Connectors) - why and how to use carefully.**

What are connectors in simple words? These are permissions you give ChatGPT for access to your services: Google Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, GitHub, etc. Through connectors the assistant gets ability to "read" your files and based on them compose answers or reports. This is convenient, but requires caution.

Why this is important (real cases)

• Plus: "Find last contract in Finance folder and write draft response to client" - assistant itself pulls document and prepares text.

• Plus: "Collect all changes in sales tables and make conclusions" - saves hours of manual work.

• Risk: if you give "manage" rights, service will be able to change/delete files - don't give such rights if not sure.

Where to enable/disable (Desktop)

• Settings → Apps & Connectors → you see service tiles → clicked "Connect" → authorized in service with OAuth → confirmed access. Connection usually shows list of permissions: view or manage. Always read exactly this list.

Security and rules

1. Give only necessary rights (preference - "view only").

2. Connect only those accounts that are really needed for the task.

3. If in doubt - connect temporarily, then Disconnect and revoke permission in service settings itself (Google Account → Security → Third-party access).

How to roll back

• In Settings → Apps & Connectors click "Disconnect" next to needed service, then go to service account and revoke access through that service's means.

**5) Data management and privacy - what's important to know briefly.**

What questions does this block solve?

• Can your chats be used to train models?

• Where and how long are logs stored?

• How to delete data permanently?

Where to look and manage?

• Settings → Data & Privacy (Data controls) - toggles like "Use my data to improve models" - disable if privacy is needed.

• Data export / data deletion option - use when necessary to request complete deletion.

OpenAI provides options to disable memory and manage data, but important: disabling data use isn't always equivalent to deleting already existing records - they need to be deleted separately. For details and deletion procedures see official instructions on Memory and Data controls.

**6) Account security - two-factor authentication (2FA).**

Why is this easiest and needed first? 2FA is the simplest and most effective way to protect account. This is when besides password a second code is needed (SMS or generator app).

How to enable in Desktop app? Settings → Security → Enable Two-Factor Authentication → follow prompts (scan QR code in generator app like Authy/Google Authenticator) → save backup codes.

How to roll back / what to remember?

• Disabled in same window, but necessarily save backup codes - if you lose device, they'll help enter account.

**5) Working with applications (Apps) - separate emphasis.**

What does this give? Allows ChatGPT to interact with local editors and applications (for example, edit code in editor, insert edits, live hints). Can enable work with applications, reconnections, auto-connection from chat panel, "form suggested edits" and "automatically apply suggested edits".

Why is this needed? This speeds up work: assistant can suggest corrections right in editor. Useful for writer, proofreader or coder, but dangerous if assistant can automatically change files without verification - so by default it's better to leave automatic application **disabled**.

**Try it:** How to set up safely?

1. Leave Enable work with applications - ON, but Automatically apply suggested edits - OFF.

2. Always look at suggested edits before applying.

3. Set up "Disconnect applications" after 15 minutes of inactivity (as in screenshot) - this reduces risk window.

**Compact list of all Settings items (and several standard Desktop ChatGPT client options), with simple explanation and "how to roll back".**

Each line: Name - what it does - how to enable/disable - how to roll back.

1. Email - linked account email - in Settings → Account - change through profile - rollback: enter other email and confirm.

2. Phone number - for recovery and 2FA - Settings → Account - delete/change in profile.

12. Accent color - visual option - Settings → Appearance - rollback: Default.

13. Show additional models - model visibility toggle - Settings → Advanced - OFF/ON - rollback: disable.

14. Automatically correct spelling - spellcheck - ON/OFF - rollback: return as was.

15. Open ChatGPT links in desktop app - link redirection - ON/OFF - rollback: disable.

16. Check for updates - manual version check - Settings → Check for updates - rollback: not applicable.

17. Map provider - map choice (Apple Maps / Google) - Settings → Maps provider - rollback: change provider.

18. Screen position, Reset to new chat, Keyboard shortcut, Open new chats - chat panel - small UX settings - change in Chat panel → return standard values.

19. Enable work with applications - permission to interact with editors - ON/OFF - rollback: OFF; unbind applications. (recommend keeping ON and auto-apply OFF)

20. Switch connection / Disconnect applications / Application management - managing sessions with applications - use for security - rollback: click "Disconnect" and revoke access in applications.

21. Automatic connection with applications from chat panel - automatic connection pickup - ON/OFF - rollback: OFF.

22. Form suggested edits / Automatically apply suggested edits - editorial suggestions - ON/OFF - don't enable auto-apply without verification.

23. Speech: Voice / Primary language / Audio settings - voice engine and recognition/voicing language - choose voice and language - rollback: change back.

24. Autocomplete / Popular search queries / Tracking suggestions - hints and suggestions - ON/OFF - rollback: disable if interferes.

25. Personalization - Memory - Link to saved memory / Reference chat history - (more detail above) - ON/OFF and Manage memories.

26. ADVANCED: Web search / Code / Canvas / Advanced voice - these features usually activate in Advanced/Personalization: enabling gives browsing, code interpreter, collaborative canvas and improved voice - carefully enable, check what permissions are requested. For browser memory and its controls there are separate controls (see docs about Atlas).

**Nuances for browser version (web) and mobile version.**

Browser version (web.chatgpt.com / Atlas)

• In browser version Atlas / Browser is available - integrated browser (it can store "browser memories" - excerpts/summaries of page content) and separate controls for these browser memories. There are separate controls where you can view, disable and delete Browser memories. Some settings may be administered (on work device admin can block).

• Parental control implemented in web version: can invite parent and manage teen's settings; pairing set up in Settings → Parental controls.

Mobile version (iOS / Android)

• Mobile version usually repeats personalization and memory, but some functions (for example, Project-only memory or part of integrations) may be unavailable on mobile at release time. Always check in Settings → Personalization and in app Release Notes.

• Pulse, Sora (video) and some experimental features often require Pro/plan and may roll out first to mobile devices with Pro access (which is noted in release notes). Follow updates in official help.
