6. Advanced Functions and AI Limitations. What Not to Expect? This is for Adults.

Using advanced functions, you can implement 80-90% of standard tasks related to analysis, processing, synthesis of texts and any information, programming, working with images, conducting research, gathering information and thousands of other things that AI will do instead of you without compromising quality or accelerating your productivity many times over.

However, AI at its current stage of development is not God, but an executor; it has limitations, and knowing them, being able to overcome them - you will get outstanding results quickly, rather than being disappointed and wasting time uselessly. Perceive AI as a violin - with skill you can extract divine sounds, but if you hammer nails with a violin, you will undoubtedly experience severe disappointment.

When you're just starting out, you're often inclined to blame AI for stupidity if the result didn't satisfy you. You can believe (or not), but the quality of the result that AI gives you in responses depends 95% on the quality of your requests and general approaches in working with AI, on your understanding of nuances, on your skills in using AI's vast capabilities. Want to reach for the stars - keep reading the book and do all the simple exercises, try them immediately. However, for the lazy, who don't want to learn and look for someone to blame in everything - AI won't help. Sorry for this sad admonition. There are no miracles, except in your head and heart. Don't look for miracles in AI, look for them in yourself.

**Connecting applications and organizing work**

AI allows you to integrate third-party applications such as **Google Drive, Notion, Cursor** and others. This is useful if you need to simultaneously work with documents or notes, and AI can interact with them in real time. When we say "connecting applications" - it means that the AI system doesn't just answer questions or generate text, but can interact with other programs/services (for example, Google Drive, Notion, Zapier/Make). These connections provide new capabilities: automation, data synchronization, workflow arrangements.

![][PastedGraphic2]

For example: AI can find a file on Google Drive, read it, make changes, update a note in Notion, notify you or colleagues by e-mail, create a task in the project management system - without you manually switching from app to app and copying/pasting. Connecting applications is **not mandatory**. That is, the basic functions of an AI chat (input-output) work without integrations. Connections are an extension of capabilities. Imagine yourself (or me) as a marketing and automation consultant (a suitable situation for my profile).

**Scenario**: you run a blog, do newsletters, collect ideas and notes in Notion, work with documents in Google Drive. You want AI to help not only generate text, but also automatically update your system.

**How a workflow with integrations might look**:

1. You mark a task in Notion: "Write a guide article about AI for beginners."
2. Automation connects Notion with ChatGPT: AI receives data from the task ("topic", "target audience", "key points") and generates a draft article.
3. Then AI saves the draft to Google Drive, creates a copy of the file, puts it in the "Drafts" folder.
4. AI notifies you in Slack or Telegram: "Draft is ready - check it."
5. At your command, AI can then send the article to the newsletter or prepare a social media post.

Less manual work, fewer switches between applications, smoother workflow. At the same time, you can still manually enter a topic in ChatGPT and get text, but then copy-paste, create files, notify yourself manually - all this remains your work. **Connecting applications** - allows you to save time and reduce "routine switching" between applications, increases efficiency: AI becomes part of the workflow, not just a tool, creates a more "smooth" experience - less friction in the transition from idea to execution.

But there are also "downsides": Connections may require setup, possibly knowledge of integration platforms or assistance from others. More integrations - higher risk of errors, data leaks or incorrect automation. If you rarely use a complex chain of applications, the benefit may be small - AI's basic function may be enough.

**By the way**: I personally don't use application connections, although possibly due to laziness and not seeing obvious benefit, but I know those who actively use them. And then, perhaps I'm paranoid, but I have concerns about security. We'll talk a lot about this problem below - it's very, very important! Play around - maybe you'll find something useful for yourself.

**"Edit in Canvas" mode**

Allows you to split the screen into two windows: in one, communication with AI goes on, in the other - an editable text. This is convenient when working with documents, since you can correct the result right during the dialogue.

![][Снимокэкрана2025-11-03в000307]

Imagine that you're talking to ChatGPT, and next to it - a window is open where you can edit text live: an article, script, letter, idea. This is the **"Edit in Canvas" mode (or Canvas Mode)**. It divides the screen into two parts: **on the left** - your chat with AI, where you discuss what and how needs to be corrected; **on the right** - the document itself, where you can immediately see and edit the text being created or corrected.

**Why is this needed?** Previously, you had to copy text from the chat, paste it into an editor, change it, return to AI again - inconvenient. Now everything happens **in one place**, without switching. AI sees the document text and can offer targeted edits, improvements, ideas right in the process. And you - decide for yourself whether to accept the suggestion, correct it manually or write it anew.

**Example (case) situation:** you're writing a blog article about how to stop being afraid of artificial intelligence. You open a new document in ChatGPT and turn on "Edit in Canvas" mode. In the right window you start a draft - enter a couple of paragraphs. In the left window you ask AI: *"Make the introduction more lively, add some humor, but without banalities."* ChatGPT analyzes the text and offers specific changes - right in this same document. You see the suggestions, choose which to keep, which to reject. In a minute you already have an improved version of the text - without constant copying between programs.

**What's convenient?** Real-time editing, you can edit without interrupting the conversation with AI. Everything is visible contextually. AI understands the text structure and sees what you've already written. Suitable for working on long texts, Articles, books, scripts, letters - everything where style and structure matter.

Imagine that you're sitting with an editor at one table: you dictate ideas, and he writes right away and offers phrase variants. You correct, he reacts instantly. "Edit in Canvas" mode is the same effect, only instead of a live person, AI works nearby.

**Try**: Turn on Canvas mode (by clicking "+" and "More"), and enter a prompt: "We're talking about the capabilities of the paid version of chatGPT. Expand and explain in more understandable words for a non-techie, give an example, a case: 'Edit in Canvas' mode. Allows splitting the screen into two windows: in one, communication with AI goes on, in the other - editable text. This is convenient when working with documents, since you can correct the result right during the dialogue." This is one of those cases when it's easier to see than to read, and remember - if something is unclear - immediately ask your chatGPT, and if completely unclear, take a screenshot and ask for explanations - effective 100%.

![][PastedGraphic3]

What will you see (approximately)?

![][PastedGraphic4]

Here's the most interesting thing - the Edit button, press it and you'll see the next picture.

![][PastedGraphic5]

1. Left side of screen — Chat window with AI. This is the familiar dialogue zone with ChatGPT. Here you ask questions and give instructions (for example: *"rewrite this paragraph simpler"*), receive answers and suggestions from AI, see the history of your messages and model responses. You can discuss edits, ask to improve the text, set tone or style. AI sees what document you're working on and gives contextual suggestions.

2. Right side of screen — Canvas. This is a built-in text editor where the document itself is displayed. You can write and edit text manually, see changes suggested by AI, instantly apply or reject them. The feature: this text is linked to your dialogue. ChatGPT "understands" what you're currently editing and takes this into account in responses.

3. Toolbar above the document. There are buttons for: Text formatting (bold, italic, headings, etc.); Collaboration with AI - the *"Ask ChatGPT"* button allows you to select a text fragment and immediately get a suggestion for improvement; Settings and actions with the document (save, copy, export, etc.).

4. "Suggest changes" button (bottom right) allows you to ask AI to make edits to the entire document or part of it. ChatGPT will suggest an updated version right in this same window.

5. Bottom panel under the chat - standard input line where you can write requests manually, activate voice input, turn on canvas mode (the "Canvas" button next to the "+" icon) to switch between regular chat and editor.

Everything is combined in one space: chat + document + intelligence. No need to copy, switch between windows and editors - the entire process of writing, editing and refining text goes in a single flow.

**Saving dialogues** - not directly provided, but there are several ways:

* **Copy individual response** - you can manually save important fragments.
* **Select entire dialogue** - copy entirely and paste into a text editor.

Some models allow generating files, but this process doesn't always work correctly. If full dialogue export is important, so far the most reliable way remains manual copying.

**Creating custom (user) GPT models**

This is a big and very cool topic, which we'll have a large section devoted to, because the ability to create custom (user) GPT models gives you a real productivity boost. Here just the main idea - the system allows creating your own specialized AI (GPT models) for solving specific routine frequently repeated tasks requiring a complex prompt. For example, if you often need to edit transcribed text, you can create a special model that automatically performs processing, getting rid of errors and unnecessary words.

There's an option to publish such models publicly or use them only for personal needs. For this, there's a builder profile where you can configure public or closed access.

**Why is this super convenient?** When frequently working with AI, it's important to have prepared prompts in advance. And, honestly speaking, creating an effective prompt is a kind of art (which you'll master by reading the book), plus it requires time, and if you have to enter a complex prompt each time manually, it's inconvenient. Creating custom GPTs is the ability to save and configure prompts, which allows using prompts many times, duplicating successful prompts, making many versions, automating routine tasks, avoiding constant input of the same instructions, creating many **(GPT-ettes)** that adapt to different tasks. In the free version there's no such capability, which makes work less convenient.

**Projects**

This is also a big topic, which we'll have a large section devoted to, but briefly - this function allows working on large projects where there are many thematic chats, documents, tables, images in one place. The project function allows saving work context, because AI remembers details of different chats within the project, adding files for analysis and work, working with different AI models depending on tasks within the project. This significantly increases work efficiency, especially in long-term research or analytics, content creation, writing voluminous and complexly structured texts.

**Deep Search (Deep Research)**

Oh, about this function you can talk long and in detail and a section will also be devoted to it, but briefly - this is a bomb, a "long run" across the internet: AI itself plans steps, searches through dozens-hundreds of sources, reads, verifies versions, and then issues a coherent report with links. Essentially - "researcher-analyst inside ChatGPT". ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**When to turn on the mode, and when not?**

* **Turn on**, if the question is complex: "Collect a market X overview", "Compare A/B approaches in research", "Prepare a synopsis of sources on topic Y". AI does multi-step research and gives a detailed report with quotes. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10500283-deep-research-faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Don't turn on** for quick facts/news - there regular "Search" is enough (short answer + links). The difference: **Search = quick and short; Deep Research = longer and deeper**. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Example:** you're preparing a book chapter "How not to be afraid of AI" and want a section "Ethics and risks".

1. You formulate a request: "Collect the position of leading universities and NGOs on AI risks for the last 2-3 years. Give 5-7 key theses, indicate primary sources".
2. Deep Research suggests a plan: what terms to search for, what institutes and reviews to check, what years/regions to cover. You accept or adjust the plan, answer clarifying questions.
3. AI reads sources, compares conclusions, marks discrepancies, forms **a report with quotes** and "what to check manually".
4. You ask: "Compress into 2 pages and add a 'what's controversial' block". You get the final text + list of links (for verification and footnotes). ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**What can be connected as sources**

By default - open network + your uploaded files. If you connect supported applications (drive/notes, etc.), AI will be able to rely on them too **with your permission**. All conclusions are accompanied by links. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10500283-deep-research-faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Limits and availability (briefly)**

The function is available for paid plans (Plus/Team/Enterprise/Edu), with monthly task limits; there's also a "lightweight" version for quick/cheap runs (Free has very limited). Specific quotas change - check the counter in the interface. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Deep Research -** saves hours of manual googling, gives **a structured report with sources**. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-launches-new-ai-tool-facilitate-research-tasks-2025-02-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), better identifies contradictions between articles and marks "what else to check". ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), works longer than regular search mode (Search); part of conclusions still requires human verification of source quality, limits on number of tasks; availability and quotas depend on plan/region. ([OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10500283-deep-research-faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**How to request Deep Research correctly (template):** "Form a topic **X** overview for **period**; list **3-5** key positions, give **quotes/links** to primary sources; mark **discrepancies** and **gaps** in data; format **conclusions + list of checks**". Such a request gives AI a clear plan: framework, format, quality criteria.

**Case 1. Preparing an analytical overview. Situation:** you're preparing an article "How AI is changing the education market".
You want not just examples, but specifically a trend overview, expert quotes, links to sources.

**Prompt:**

Conduct deep research on the topic "the impact of artificial intelligence on education in 2022-2025". Collect 5-7 key trends with indication of sources, quotes and dates. Divide the result into: 1) current changes, 2) risks, 3) forecast for 3 years. Indicate which sources raise doubts and why.

**What Deep Research does:** Reviews reports, research, EdTech company news and prepares a structured overview with direct links to sources.

**Case 2. Comparing strategies or approaches. Situation:** you're consulting business and want to understand how AI implementation strategies differ at OpenAI, Anthropic and Google DeepMind.

**Prompt:**

Compare AI development strategies of OpenAI, Anthropic and Google DeepMind companies over the last two years. Determine: 1) key goals, 2) philosophy of approach to safety, 3) business model, 4) expert forecast. Give sources and mark discrepancies in their assessments.

**What Deep Research does:** Goes through corporate publications, interviews, official statements, analytical articles - and issues a comparative table/overview.

**Case 3. Preparing a lecture, book or course. Situation:** you're writing a book "AI - new freedom" and want a chapter about how AI affects creativity.

**Prompt:** Prepare an analytical study on the topic "AI's impact on creative professions" with examples from 2023-2025. Divide material into blocks: 1) positive effects, 2) losses and conflicts, 3) development forecast. Add 5 expert quotes and 5 links to real cases (music, cinema, literature). Mark which conclusions are controversial and why.

**What Deep Research does:** Collects fresh interviews, Creative Commons reports, cases of musicians, writers, directors - and forms a structured synopsis with facts and quotes.

**Model limitations. Why AI is not a magician, but a tool?**

Yes, ChatGPT can do a lot: write texts, explain complex things, come up with ideas, even code. But it's important to understand - **it's not God and not a thinker**, but **an executor**, and a very obedient one. It does what you tell it, **within the framework of its logic, memory and data** it was trained on. It's like a tool - **a violin, brush or camera**. In skilled hands they create masterpieces, but in unskilled ones - they cause disappointment.

**Why does it sometimes seem that AI is "being stupid"?** It doesn't know your intentions. It doesn't sense context if you haven't explained it directly. If you gave a general request - you'll get a too general answer. If you asked a clear, contextual and structured question - you'll get an accurate and deep result.

Bad prompt - "Write text about business." Good prompt - "Write a short Instagram post about how an entrepreneur can stop being afraid of AI. Tone - friendly, with humor, length - up to 100 words." The difference will be colossal, because AI doesn't guess your thoughts, it **follows instruction, prompt**.

**Main AI limitations (at current time) worth knowing**

1. **It doesn't know the future.** Everything it writes is analysis of past and present, not prediction.
2. **It doesn't read your mind.** You need to explicitly indicate goals, style, audience and format.
3. **It can make mistakes.** Even if it writes confidently. Therefore - verify.
4. **It doesn't replace experience.** It accelerates the path to result, but responsibility for choice and meaning remains yours.

To get quality answers from AI, it's important to learn how to formulate requests correctly (**prompts**). The main principle - the more precise the request, the better the result. Simple requests work in most cases, but complex tasks require more detail. Additionally, finding the ideal answer often requires an **iterative approach**:

**First answer** - often basic, may not meet expectations. You give **additional clarifications** - they allow directing AI in the right direction. Then - **sequential improvement** - request correction leads to a more accurate result. A common mistake - making one request, getting a non-optimal answer and immediately thinking AI is "stupid". It's much more productive to make corrections and refine the request.
